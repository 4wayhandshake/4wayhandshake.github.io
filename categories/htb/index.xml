&lt;p>The challenge is involves a strange little webserver (using &lt;code>Flask&lt;/code> running on &lt;code>Gunicorn&lt;/code>) positioned behind a caching proxy (using Nginx). There is some kind of &lt;code>bot&lt;/code> mechanism for crawling the site. Aside from the bot, the only relevant URLs are for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>registration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>login&lt;/li>
&lt;li>retrieving our own profile&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re free to register a user, then access our own profile info.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/cdnio/registration%20page.png" alt="registration page">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can also access our own profile info. Presumably the feature to retrieve our profile is for the sake of accessing our API key?​&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alphascii Clashing</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/alphascii-clash/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/alphascii-clash/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This challenge was super easy - I saw the vulnerability right away. Instead of just finishing it quickly, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d get around to doing something that has been on my To-Do list for &lt;em>far too long&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Finally learning to use Pwntools for CTFs&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> &amp;#x1f480;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually, I just write socket code. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that this is clearly the &amp;ldquo;slow&amp;rdquo; way to do things. If I&amp;rsquo;m going to go faster in future CTFs, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to use some libraries to speed up my coding!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Armaxis</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/armaxis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/armaxis/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Starting the challenge, we&amp;rsquo;re given two ports, corresponding to two components: a website and an web-based email client. The website presents a simple login/registration form, and the email client brings us straight into an inbox without any authentication:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/armaxis/email.png" alt="email">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick skim through the website code suggests that this email client will probably be used for password resets.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="code-analysis">CODE ANALYSIS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As usual, I like to read through the code sequentially, starting from startup/initialization code (the &lt;code>Dockerfile&lt;/code>, then &lt;code>index.js&lt;/code>, etc) and ending with the &lt;code>views&lt;/code>. Thankfully, this one didn&amp;rsquo;t take a lot of reading before I discovered a couple vulnerable sections of code &amp;#x1f913;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heal</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/heal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/heal/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I arrived at &lt;em>Heal&lt;/em> a couple months after it was released. At the face of it, &lt;em>Heal&lt;/em> is about a website that has a simple resume-building service. I never really figured out how the name &amp;ldquo;Heal&amp;rdquo; relates to the box or icon. While it was on the easier side of &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to do way too much recon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything you need to know from recon can be found by &amp;ldquo;spidering&amp;rdquo; the website using a web app proxy (I&amp;rsquo;ll be using ZAP in this one). From here, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover a couple of subdomains and gain an understanding of how they work. The target in front of you is actually very minimal - almost everything is offloaded onto the subdomains. If you play with the app a little, you will surely notice a moment when the server trusts some data that it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t; exploiting that is half of the battle; the other half is doing research on common files that the target&amp;rsquo;s framework uses for configuration. This will lead to a successful foothold into a web app dashboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cat</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/cat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/cat/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Cat&lt;/em> was released as the fourth box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 7 &lt;em>Vice&lt;/em>&amp;hellip; and it was an absolute delight! If you&amp;rsquo;re searching for a fun box to try some web attacks, look no further!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Plus, what is more fitting for a web-oriented box than a website for ranking cute cat photos? &amp;#x1f431;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Recon was easy, as long as &lt;code>.git&lt;/code> is in your go-to dirbusting wordlist. Once discovering the exposed .git directory, you can read through the target&amp;rsquo;s website source code. Read through the source code carefully, and look for mistakes that the programmer made - there are more than one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compiled</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/compiled/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/compiled/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to say I had a fun time with &lt;em>Compiled&lt;/em>, but I really didn&amp;rsquo;t. It had several good learning moments, but also a lot of really painful and time-consuming steps. It was very much a &amp;ldquo;CVE box&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon was easy. The initial nmap scans tell us almost everything we need to know. Two HTTP services are found right away, and the default script scan shows the presence of a subdomain. Avoid the pitfall here of investigating one of the services too deeply without checking out the other one, too. The services are highly related to each other; it will make a lot more sense after seeing both. Remember to &lt;em>write down versions of everything&lt;/em> when you see them, and don&amp;rsquo;t skip the vuln research!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BigBang</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/bigbang/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/bigbang/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>BigBang&lt;/em> was released as the third box of Season 7 &lt;em>Vice&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s rated as Hard, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s more correctly classified as Insane. It took me roughly 35h to complete, research and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon was pretty simple, at surface level. The target is just a standard Wordpress site. Do a bit of Wordpress-specific recon to find some interesting things about the site. Try finding the interactive elements on the page, and you will quickly see a way to upload files. If you can turn this into an arbitrary upload, you&amp;rsquo;re well on the way to foothold.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spellbound Servants</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spellbound-servants/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spellbound-servants/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure about the description on this one&amp;hellip; To me, it just looks like a partially-finished storefront &amp;#x1f602;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As long as you don&amp;rsquo;t get too bogged-down with all the Flask-related code, this challenge is really easy. A bit of code analysis leads directly to the solution, which involves only a single step of deserialization to accomplish. Besides the vulnerability, this challenge presents a great example of writing a clean &amp;amp; tidy Flask server.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>C O P</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/c-o-p/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/c-o-p/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>C O P&lt;/em> (Cult of Pickles) is an Easy web challenge, involving requireing equal portions of SQLi, and deserialization, and brine. The challenge is a very minimal web app, demonstrating a bit of a &amp;ldquo;toy problem&amp;rdquo; with SQLi arising from a failure to use SQL prepared statements and sloppy Flask+Jinja2 templating code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Achieving actual RCE is a bit challenging, but mostly because of a very strange issue. Formulation of your attack steps and writing the exploit is not too bad. Be sure to read my &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/c-o-p/#finish-the-exploit-script">warnings&lt;/a> within the Exploit section to avoid my pitfalls.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>POP Restaurant</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/pop-restaurant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/pop-restaurant/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/pop-restaurant/login%20page.png" alt="login page">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>POP Restaurant&lt;/em>, by @&lt;a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/users/1051133">khanhhnahk1&lt;/a>, is an excellent demonstration of why secure coding practices are important. As is hinted by the name, we utilize a PHP &lt;em>POP chain&lt;/em> to execute arbitrary PHP on the target.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="first-take">FIRST TAKE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&amp;#x1f60d; This UI is &lt;em>adorbs&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a PHP-based web app. Besides the database interfacing code, everything looks like it&amp;rsquo;s entirely custom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can register a user, then start placing &amp;ldquo;orders&amp;rdquo; to the restaurant. We can order pizza, icecream, or spaghetti. Once we click one of the order buttons, our order appears in the pane below:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backfire</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/backfire/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/backfire/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Backfire&lt;/em> was released as the second box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 7, &lt;em>Vice&lt;/em>. HTB claims this one is a &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo; difficulty, but I cannot agree. Maybe the lateral movement and privesc were a &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo;, but getting the user flag was frustratingly hard. More importantly though, it was extremely niche, and required a lot of scripting to stitch together two very specific exploits into one. If you&amp;rsquo;re running this box and expecting &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo; difficulty, do as I did and seek out as complete of a PoC as you can&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LinkVortex</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/linkvortex/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/linkvortex/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>LinkVortex&lt;/em> was all about the recon steps. A little bit of OSINT with a portion of web fuzzing is all that it takes. First though, we must discover the technology that the target website runs on, do a little reading on how it works, and make some educated guesses about directory structure: only then will we find the dashboard login. On the dashboard login, we discover a username oracle. Finally, after finding a vulnerable subdomain, we are able to do some &lt;code>.git&lt;/code> reconstruction to obtain some hardcoded credentials in the source code. Combining all of those clues together, we can finally gain access to the dashboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spookifier</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spookifier/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spookifier/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Spookifier&lt;/em> is an excellent introduction to a very fun class of web vulnerabilities. It makes for a nice little &amp;ldquo;coffee break&amp;rdquo; challenge. Perfect if you don&amp;rsquo;t have much time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="first-take">FIRST TAKE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Start by downloading the files. It&amp;rsquo;s a docker container with a Flask application inside. Read the code, and realize there&amp;rsquo;s only one endpoint inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong>Python Flask&lt;/strong> server and uses &lt;strong>Mako&lt;/strong> as a template engine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spookifier/challenge%20dir.png" alt="challenge dir">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spookypass</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spookypass/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spookypass/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Super easy challenge. This challenge introduces a beginner at reversing into opening their tools and checking inside a file.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="first-take">FIRST TAKE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Start by downloading the file. We can check &lt;code>file&lt;/code> to see the file type:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>./pass: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=3008217772cc2426c643d69b80a96c715490dd91, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, not stripped&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Try running the executable. It presents you with a simple prompt, asking the password:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UnderPass</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/underpass/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/underpass/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>UnderPass&lt;/em> was a nice, quick and cheerful box. A perfect choice if you have limited time but feel the itch to hack something. Kudos to the box creator, &lt;em>@dakkmaddy&lt;/em>, for putting together this treat. It was released between Season 6 and 7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon was pleasant, and a great reminder to always include some UDP scanning (even if it usually isn&amp;rsquo;t very useful). It was a mixture of OSINT, Web enumeration, and SNMP. After gathering sufficient clues, it should be pretty easy to locate the correct service to attack. Hopefully, research already turned up some default credentials for the vulnerable service, because that&amp;rsquo;s what lets you into the dashboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EscapeTwo</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/escapetwo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/escapetwo/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Alright! Here comes Season 7, &lt;em>Vice&lt;/em>. Our first box is Windows, rated Easy. Right away, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that we&amp;rsquo;re provided a credential for this one, for the &lt;code>rose&lt;/code> account. With this credential, we successfully accessed SMB shares on the &lt;code>sequel.htb&lt;/code> server finding the &lt;code>Accounting Department&lt;/code> which contained garbled spreadsheets that, when opened as archives and read as raw XML, revealed a list of names and credentials. One of these credentials gave access to MS-SQL, that had &lt;code>xp_cmdshell&lt;/code> enabled - providing us a foothold of RCE.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Forest</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/forest/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/forest/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>Forest&lt;/em> is 100% Active Directory&lt;/strong>. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, a box with no webserver and only AD is a bit like staring at a blank wall - it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know where to start with enumeration. &lt;em>Forest&lt;/em> is fantastic practice to break you out of that mindset, and help understand good methods for attacking AD environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon mostly consists of going through checklists of ways to enumerate active directory in an unauthenticated manner. It helps a lot to know a few good methods to try, and see how far that gets you. &lt;em>Forest&lt;/em> was all about being methodical and knowing when you&amp;rsquo;ve found something useful. The only thing we really need to realize during recon is that &lt;strong>Kerberos preauthentication is disabled&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chemistry</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/chemistry/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/chemistry/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Chemistry&lt;/em> was released as the penultimate box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s season 6, &lt;em>Heist&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s about breaking into a custom service for analyzing a scientific data file. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve seen tools like this before, where some expert in a non-tech field knows just enough coding to solve a problem for themselves? It&amp;rsquo;s admirable that people do this type of thing, but these tools are often doomed by poor security - as we&amp;rsquo;ll see in this box.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Instant</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/instant/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/instant/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Instant&lt;/em> was released for week 11 of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 6, &lt;em>Heist&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s about a company that provides a money transfer service - both an app and an accompanying API. While it&amp;rsquo;s marked as &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo; box, I would personally rate this one more as an &amp;ldquo;Easy&amp;rdquo;. The most difficult aspect is having knowledge of the correct tools to use (and a bit of determination during enumeration).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The website urges us to download an app, in the form of an Android APK. By reverse-engineering this app, we find some poorly-protected secrets, but we can also find a couple subdomains that were (probably) previously unknown. One is the API that the app interacts with, and the other is a Swagger instance that documents the API. By analyzing the API and using a very basic attack, we can gain an easy foothold on the system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sightless</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/sightless/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/sightless/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Sightless&lt;/em> is the box for week 6 of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 6 &lt;em>Heist&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s a very creative box. While each step of this box is relatively simple, the creator (&lt;strong>EmSec&lt;/strong>) throws many creative challenges at us with this one. There are a few rabbit-holes to watch out for, and it can be easy to feel a little lost while seeking privesc to root. &lt;em>Sightless&lt;/em> requires you to actually work inside some GUI applications, instead of being able to root the box solely through a terminal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MonitorsThree</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/monitorsthree/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/monitorsthree/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>MonitorsThree&lt;/em> was released as the fourth box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s season 6, &lt;em>Heist&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting addition to the &amp;ldquo;Monitors&amp;rdquo; line of boxes, all of which prominently feature the &lt;strong>Cacti&lt;/strong> monitoring tool. This box took a little bit of research to complete, but was generally on the easier side of &amp;ldquo;medium&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon was almost nonessential. Once you discover the &lt;code>cacti&lt;/code> subdomain, you&amp;rsquo;re ready to proceed. Fingerprint the two apps you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered, then check out the main &lt;code>monitorsthree&lt;/code> app in more detail. The site has a couple forms on it; running a popular tool to abuse these forms is enough to get you started on a foothold. From there, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover a credential leading you back to the &lt;code>cacti&lt;/code> web app. A little bit of vulnerability research goes a long way here. By exploiting a well known vulnerability (with well-documented PoC), you&amp;rsquo;ll gain an easy foothold.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lantern</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/lantern/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/lantern/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Is it Linux? I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure&amp;hellip; &amp;#x1f914;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Lantern&lt;/em>, the third box in HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 6 &lt;em>Heist&lt;/em>, claims to be a Linux box, but in most respects actually it&amp;rsquo;s actually running things as one might in Windows. It isn&amp;rsquo;t until the very end of privesc to root that we find anything Linux-specific. &lt;em>Lantern&lt;/em> is about a generic IT services company running a landing page and an admin panel. What made this one a little special is its extensive use of &lt;em>Blazor&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GreenHorn</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/greenhorn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/greenhorn/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>GreenHorn&lt;/em> was introduced in the time between the fifth and sixth HTB seasons. It&amp;rsquo;s about a web development company that prides itself on hiring very inexperienced developers. Thankfully for us, the boss also has very bad security practices &amp;#x1f602;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon is very fast. First, recognize that there are two ports to investigate: both ports 80 and 3000 are running HTTP servers. Check them both out before doing anything else. As it turns out, one of them is hosting a git repo for the other - so finding critical sensitive details is very easy. Accessing the service on port 80, we can get a version number of the software being used. Some quick searching should lead to a CVE and a number of PoC exploits for it. Exploit the known vulnerability to gain a foothold on the system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sea</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/sea/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/sea/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Sea&lt;/em> was released as the second box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 6, &lt;em>Heist&lt;/em>. With proper recon, it&amp;rsquo;s a very short box. Perhaps they will fix it after the season ends, but this box actually comes pre-exploited: to gain foothold, all you have to do is find the exploit and use it. It&amp;rsquo;s totally doable to figure out how to exploit it yourself though - that&amp;rsquo;s the method that I&amp;rsquo;ll outline in this walkthrough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resource</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/resource/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/resource/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Resource&lt;/em> was released as first box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 6, &lt;em>Heist&lt;/em>. The box was created by the famous user, &lt;code>0xdf&lt;/code> - and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint! This box establishes a whole fictional company and a narrative of the scenario, to a degree that is rare among HTB boxes. We find ourselves attacking an IT service company that is going through a period of their certificate and key management. The box is full of rabbit-holes and distractions, making it slightly frustrating but definitely a more realistic simulation than many other HTB boxes. Although the steps in &lt;em>Resource&lt;/em> tend to be short, they are numerous: by my count, I had to do five pivots between separate users to complete this box.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PermX</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/permx/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/permx/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>PermX&lt;/em> is about exploiting a learning management system called &lt;em>Chamilo&lt;/em>. The box was pretty easy, and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long to finish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon mostly involves uncovering a couple subdomains. One of them is the usual, obvious subdomain, but the other is a bit more odd. Accessing the &amp;ldquo;more odd&amp;rdquo; subdomain allows you to know the name of the CMS you&amp;rsquo;re up against. Applying a little directory enumeration will reveal that you can actually access several directories in &amp;ldquo;file browser&amp;rdquo; mode, basically eliminating the need to do any file enumeration. One of these files will reveal the exact version of the CMS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PDFy</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/pdfy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2029 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/pdfy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>PDFy&lt;/em> is a web challenge by the prolific @makelaris. It&amp;rsquo;s about exploiting a known vulnerability in the &lt;code>wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code> application - a solution for parsing HTML and printing it into a PDF using a built-in stylesheet. Since we know the goal of this challenge was to disclose a file, it&amp;rsquo;s not overly challenging to find a vulnerability to suit our needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By far, the biggest obstacle on &lt;em>PDFy&lt;/em> is overcoming the lack of a VPN connection. This one requires you to host a resource on the public internet - something that has been a huge roadblock for me in the past, on other challenges and CTF competitions. This challenge forced me to explore what tools exist for getting around the lack of VPN (without using a leased VPS). Ultimately, I settled on a paid subscription to &lt;strong>Pinggy&lt;/strong>, which I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BoardLight</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/boardlight/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/boardlight/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>BoardLight&lt;/em> was the 6th box in HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season V &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy Linux box, focused on a web hosting platform. As far as I can tell, its name and icon have nothing to do with the box itself. Unfortunately, I was away when the box was released, and kicking myself for it - it would have been great to have such easy points on the scoreboard!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon is very quick. &lt;code>Whatweb&lt;/code> reveals the domain of the target, and a quick scan for subdomains will reveal the vulnerable web app. From there, default credentials grant you entry to the web app dashboard. While the dashboard itself isn&amp;rsquo;t immediately useful, the credentials are helpful for the Authenticated RCE exploit that you can apply to the web app to gain a foothold.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Editorial</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/editorial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/editorial/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Editorial&lt;/em> was released for week 9 of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season V: &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>. With only three steps involved in its solution, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the easiest boxes in the season so far. That being said, twice on this box I ended up kicking myself for having not done something that later seemed obvious, so perhaps &lt;em>Editorial&lt;/em> teaches us a lesson in a more subtle way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is basically no recon involved in &lt;em>Editorial&lt;/em>. Identify the ports, add the domain to your &lt;code>/etc/hosts&lt;/code>, and explore the website. The website only has three pages, so you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly locate the component to attack. From there, you&amp;rsquo;ll find out that this component can be used for SSRF. Follow &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/ssrf/">my SSRF checklist&lt;/a> (Disclaimer: it&amp;rsquo;s a work-in-progress) to expedite things a little. Once you interact with the internally-accessible server via the SSRF, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly discover some credentials. Use those to gain a foothold.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blurry</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blurry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blurry/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Blurry&lt;/em> was released as the eighth box in HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season V, &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>. This box is all about attacking an AI/ML platform called &lt;code>ClearML&lt;/code>. &lt;code>ClearML&lt;/code> is a system for orchestrating various AI/ML platforms, running models and experiments on a remote server. It has an extensive Python API, which we use repeatedly while solving this box. This box is on the easier side of &amp;ldquo;medium&amp;rdquo;, but was still a reasonable challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Freelancer</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/freelancer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/freelancer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my opinion, &lt;em>Freelancer&lt;/em> was a very tough box. It was released as the 7th box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season V &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s about attacking an Active Directory environment that&amp;rsquo;s running a freelancer job market website. Solving this box requires a wide array of skills. However, while a many skills are required, none of the individual steps in the solution are painfully difficult. It is a long box though, with roughly equal amounts of labour required for foothold, the user flag, and for privilege escalation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IClean</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/iclean/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/iclean/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my opinion, &lt;em>IClean&lt;/em> was a really cool box. It provides a pleasant balance of recon, exploitation, and CTF-style puzzle-solving. This box provides a more realistic web attack surface than many other boxes - there are lots of pages to explore, and many ways that one could think to attack them. I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend &lt;em>IClean&lt;/em> to anyone that wants a reasonably challenging (but not too long) web-focused box. Personally, I think this one is on the &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; side of medium difficulty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SolarLab</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/solarlab/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/solarlab/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>SolarLab&lt;/em> was released as the fourth box in HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season V &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>. Although it&amp;rsquo;s rated Medium, I would rate it more like an Easy. The box is about a company of three employees that are creating an instant messaging platform. The background is largely unimportant for the solution, though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This box takes little to no recon. Checking the SMB share will give you want you need to get started. Reading through or spidering the initial website on port 80 will lead you towards a subdomain on another port, where you will find a nice little web challenge for exploiting inadequate input validation / sanitization and a vulnerable backend PDF-generation library. It might take a little bit of determination to find exactly the vulnerable portion of this website, but once found it is quite easy to gain RCE, and immediately after grab the user flag.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pov</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/pov/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/pov/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>HTB released &lt;em>Pov&lt;/em> during Season IV. I didn&amp;rsquo;t play that season, so I&amp;rsquo;m coming to it a few months after. I learned a lot from this box; it really helped me polish my skills for attacking Windows using a Linux box. The pathway to the root flag is very interesting, and requires a wide array of skills. Having just completed my walkthrough for &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/mailing/">Mailing&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, this box was refreshingly straightforward: there was no guesswork, and every step led quite logically into the next.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mailing</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/mailing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/mailing/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Mailing&lt;/em> was released as the third box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 5, &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>. The box is initially about a mail server (although that ceases to be important after a foothold is achieved).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To gain a foothold, you need to make some major assumptions using a &amp;ldquo;guess and check&amp;rdquo; procedure that is not easily automated. The foothold is possible by means of exploiting a CVE for an application that you can&amp;rsquo;t be sure is even running on the target. Moreover, the exploit requires user interaction, which you can&amp;rsquo;t be sure is even happening.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intuition</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/intuition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/intuition/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I hope that Runner got you warmed up for HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 5, &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>&amp;hellip; because you&amp;rsquo;re going to need it - this one is tough! &lt;em>Intuition&lt;/em> was released as the second box of the season, requiring a wide array of skills to complete. &lt;em>Intuition&lt;/em> is very long: by my count, it has ten distinct steps to overcome (which classifies it as being on the harder end of &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; difficulty). Interestingly though, &lt;em>Intuition&lt;/em> requires very little in terms of &amp;ldquo;exploitation&amp;rdquo;; it&amp;rsquo;s mostly about finding and abusing simple misconfigurations/mistakes - which, I think, makes it a more realistic scenario than many HTB boxes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runner</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/runner/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/runner/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Are you ready for HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 5, &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>? I sure am! &lt;em>Runner&lt;/em> is the very first box of the season. Thankfully, it&amp;rsquo;s a reasonably straightforward Linux box - rated &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo; but actually more on the easy side. The box centers around a cloud-based business that offers a CI/CD solution - basically just hosting JetBrains&amp;rsquo; &lt;em>TeamCity&lt;/em> and selling it as a service. While many boxes are pretty far-removed from reality, this one was actually made from a very realistic architecture, where customers run containerized CI/CD pipelines and the service provider has some kind of management product to administer and monitor it all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Usage</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/usage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/usage/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Usage&lt;/em> was released in the short period between HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 4 and Season 5. The target is a server hosting a small blog and a set of administrative tools to manage the server. Also, the target features pretty cool little monitoring tool called &lt;strong>Monit&lt;/strong>, and seemingly also clamAV (although it didn&amp;rsquo;t factor into the attack).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Foothold is the hardest part of &lt;em>Usage&lt;/em>. After carefully examining the target and doing web enumeration on it, one only comes to the conclusion that the attack surface is quite small. However, the few interactive elements that are present do indeed have a vulnerability. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising, considering the site runs on Laravel, but the password reset form can be exploited through SQL injection. Some careful usage of &lt;code>sqlmap&lt;/code> will do wonders here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crafty</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/crafty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/crafty/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Crafty&lt;/em> is an easy-rated Windows box, released for week 6 of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season IV &lt;em>Savage Lands&lt;/em>. This box centers around exploitation of &lt;code>log4j&lt;/code> - maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of it &amp;#x1f602; It was a really big deal in 2021. While the disaster that ensued caused heaps of damage, &lt;em>very little actually changed&lt;/em> as a result of its occurrence. If anything can be said for it, at least it stoked the international dialog on supply-chain attacks and &lt;em>the failing health of the open-source ecosystem&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Insomnia</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/insomnia/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2029 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/insomnia/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Insomnia&lt;/em> is a web challenge about bypassing a login mechanism. All source code is provided, and proper analysis of the code will yield the solution. It took me longer than I care to admit to solve this one, but frankly this challenge is more on the easier side of &amp;ldquo;Easy&amp;rdquo;. Anyone that has any experience programming an authentication mechanism will see the flaw with minimal effort. Once it&amp;rsquo;s found, exploiting this flaw is trivial, and the flag can be obtained in a single web request.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simple Encryptor</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/simple-encryptor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2029 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/simple-encryptor/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This challenge is about decrypting a file that was created with a flawed form of encryption. We are provided the encrypted file, and also the encryption program. The program can easily be disassembled to examine how it functions. The code is very small, and thankfully the vulnerability is easy to locate. However, even after locating the flaw, a proper solution requires a little bit of C coding, which can be somewhat daunting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Headless</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/headless/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/headless/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The penultimate box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season IV &lt;em>Savage Lands&lt;/em>, released for week 12, is &lt;em>Headless&lt;/em>. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been participating in the season, this is one of the few boxes that I attempted within the 1 week limit. It was totally worth it! This box is an absolute delight, and I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend it enough. There aren&amp;rsquo;t any rabbit-holes on this one, and most of the effort will simply be to gain a foothold. It&amp;rsquo;s a quick box that reinforces some good hacking fundamentals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Perfection</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/perfection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/perfection/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Perfection&lt;/em> was released as the 9th box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season IV, &amp;ldquo;Savage Lands&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m coming to it two weeks late. I really enjoyed this box, even though it was quite easy. I always appreciate when the box creator builds a little bit of a narrative around the box: in this case, we were dealing with a small school and the interaction between two people (shown on the About Us page) regarding the school&amp;rsquo;s computer systems. There weren&amp;rsquo;t too many distractions on this one: if you know what you&amp;rsquo;re looking at, the solution for all steps should be readily apparent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WifineticTwo</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/wifinetictwo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/wifinetictwo/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As the 11th box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season IV, &amp;ldquo;Savage Lands&amp;rdquo;, &lt;em>WifineticTwo&lt;/em> was released mid-March 2024. Although it&amp;rsquo;s officially rated as medium difficulty, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely on the easier side of medium. The skills required to root this box are pretty minimal, but it does require a little &lt;em>out of the box&lt;/em> thinking. This box was a lot of fun, in the end. Take the name as a hint &amp;#x1f609;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon starting the box, OpenPLC is the first thing you&amp;rsquo;ll notice. It&amp;rsquo;s archived software, used for turning various devices into software-based PLCs - things like Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, where you can get pin-by-pin access to inputs and outputs. Thankfully though, it also supports x86 Linux architecture, which will lead into an easy initial foothold. Just read about prior exploits for this software and you&amp;rsquo;ll have a shell in no time. First blood for the user flag on this box took less than 8 minutes. Frankly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even follow my usual recon procedure, because the exploit to gain foothold seemed readily apparent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monitored</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/monitored/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/monitored/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Monitored&lt;/em> was released as the second box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season IV, &amp;ldquo;Savage Lands&amp;rdquo;. As is evident from visiting the index page of the box, this one centers around Nagios, an IT administration and monitoring solution for enterprise. The documentation for Nagios XI is extremely scant, which proves to be one of the main stumbling points of this box. At least 90% of the effort for this box is spent on gaining a foothold - a moment which feels perpetually just out-of-reach. Nevertheless, this box is a hard teacher: reminding us to never give up and always &lt;em>hack harder&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Love</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/love/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/love/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a week, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back into my “Let’s brush up on Windows!” series. &lt;em>Love&lt;/em> is the fifth box, following &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/toolbox/">&lt;em>Toolbox&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. This box was pretty interesting, definitely worth checking out. I really enjoyed that it avoided the whole &amp;ldquo;Find the CVE and exploit it&amp;rdquo; pattern that many Easy boxes use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It revolves around a &amp;ldquo;File Scanner&amp;rdquo; web app with some terrible security misconfigurations and mistakes. Can you find them all?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Baby Time Capsule</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-time-capsule/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-time-capsule/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Baby Time Capsule&lt;/em> is a cryptography challenge, rated &amp;ldquo;very easy&amp;rdquo;. Personally, I am not accustomed to crypto challenges, and found this one a lot more difficult than &amp;ldquo;very easy&amp;rdquo;. However, the solution only requires a very textbook attack. Anyone well-versed with RSA already should find it relatively simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once identified, the solution is conceptually simple. Like other crypto challenges, there are several implementation pitfalls to avoid when scripting a solution. If you are wise, you&amp;rsquo;ll stick to well-established libraries. See the section on &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-time-capsule/#scripting">scripting&lt;/a> for more details of how I wrote the solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Honor Among Thieves</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/honor-among-thieves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2029 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/honor-among-thieves/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This challenge is a continuation of the previous one, &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/distract-and-destroy/">Distract and Destroy&lt;/a>. Our main character, Alex, now has two others in her party. Their objective is to somehow gain the key to the treasure (the flag) by eavesdropping on a rival party.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since a lot of the setup was done in the &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/">first challenge of the series&lt;/a>, I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering it again.

&lt;p>&lt;em>The Last Dance&lt;/em> is a cryptography challenge, rated &amp;ldquo;very easy&amp;rdquo;. It is an example of a very common cryptography lesson that illustrates why you &lt;em>should never re-use the same key when encrypting two messages&lt;/em>. In this case, the &amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo; is actually a key/nonce pair, but that&amp;rsquo;s irrelevant to the solution. By recognizing three things, the player should find a solution pretty quickly:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;CHACHA20&amp;rdquo; is a stream cipher.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It utilizes XOR (which is reversible) to encrypt and decrypt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The same key (and nonce) were used to encrypt two messages, with known plaintext for one of them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="first-take">FIRST TAKE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This challenge provides two files: a python script and a text file with three lines hex data. It looks like the python script, &lt;code>source.py&lt;/code>, was used to generate the encrypted text, &lt;code>out.txt&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Distract and Destroy</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/distract-and-destroy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2029 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/distract-and-destroy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This challenge is a continuation of the previous one, &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/">Survival of the Fittest&lt;/a>. Our main character, Alex, is now accompanied by another person in her party (who I&amp;rsquo;m calling &amp;ldquo;Brock&amp;rdquo;, &lt;em>a la&lt;/em> alice-and-bob). The title, &lt;em>Distract and Destroy&lt;/em>, is a pretty huge hint in how this one will need to be solved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since a lot of the setup was done in the &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/">last challenge&lt;/a>, I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering it again.

&lt;p>Starting up the challenge, it looks like a cute little web-based side scrolling RPG. The interface is limited to just &lt;code>Attack&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Restart&lt;/code>. Despite it&amp;rsquo;s simple appearance, this challenge is actually hosting a private blockchain, where the game is running as a distributed app. The goal is simple: kill the monsters.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This was my first blockchain challenge. Even though the challenge itself was very very easy, I was quite confused about how to set up the &lt;code>hardhat&lt;/code> environment. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this walkthrough in the hopes that others won&amp;rsquo;t have to stumble over the same issues that I did.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Toolbox</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/toolbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/toolbox/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Continuing on with my “Let’s brush up on Windows!” series, &lt;em>Toolbox&lt;/em> is the fourth box. For the previous one, see &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/buff/">my walkthrough on &lt;em>Buff&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. Unfortunately, while this box was advertised as Windows, &lt;em>it&amp;rsquo;s actually 100% Linux&lt;/em>. Yes, a little disappointing, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good practice. It might not seem like it right away, but if you have some experience with &lt;code>sqlmap&lt;/code>, then &lt;em>Toolbox&lt;/em> will be a breeze.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon was very short; you are only meant to find one thing, and it appears right away. To gain a foothold, just apply a little &lt;em>ffuf-fu&lt;/em> and &lt;code>sqlmap&lt;/code> will bridge the gap. The foothold brings you straight to the user flag. From there, take a moment to fingerprint the system in front of you: a little bit of research about the system goes a long way. If you want to finish up quickly, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to pwn the system to gain the root flag.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Surveillance</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/surveillance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/surveillance/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this walkthrough, &lt;em>Surveillance&lt;/em> is still an active box. This one is all about breaking into a fictional company called that installs and operates physical security systems, such as security cameras and door access control. &lt;em>Surveillance&lt;/em> is slightly long for a Medium box, involving many rabbit-holes and escalation between three users. However, if you keep your checklists handy and take good notes, this box won&amp;rsquo;t be too challenging.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Codify</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/codify/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/codify/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Codify&lt;/em> is an easy-rated Linux box that demonstrates just how badly things can go when producing small / indie web apps in the NodeJS environment. In the modern context of tech leaning heavily on open-source projects, Codify highlights an increasingly relevant issue: &lt;em>how do we deal with open-source dependencies when those packages go stale, unmaintained, or otherwise EOL?&lt;/em> While this box was especially easy, it was an absolute delight to solve.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Buff</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/buff/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/buff/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Buff&lt;/em> is the third Windows box in my “Let’s brush up on Windows!” series. For the previous one, see &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/netmon/">my walkthrough on &lt;em>Netmon&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. This box houses a web app for a fictional gym / fitness center. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy, but requires good Windows enumeration fundamentals. Following any reasonable pentest checklist will secure a victory on this box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon is fairly unimportant with &lt;em>Buff&lt;/em>. Foothold is achieved with hardly more than a few clicks and a CVE, and leads directly to the user flag. The root flag is a little more challenging, requiring some local enumeration on the box and application of another CVE. The solution is fairly straightforward: just stick to your checklists and you&amp;rsquo;ll grab that root flag quickly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Netmon</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/netmon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/netmon/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Netmon&lt;/em> is the second Windows box in my &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s brush up on Windows!&amp;rdquo; series. For the previous one, see &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blue/">my walkthrough on &lt;em>Blue&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. This box revolves around a network monitoring tool called &lt;strong>PRTG&lt;/strong>. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy, and a great reintroduction to Windows tools. Recon leads straight into the user flag, skipping any necessity of acquiring a foothold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If recon was done properly, there are only a few options to follow when seeking the root flag. Thankfully, these options have very few rabbit-holes. Keep it simple, don&amp;rsquo;t dig in your heels on any particular method, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself in possession of the root flag in no time at all! Just remember: &lt;em>while software and vulnerabilities change all the time, human habits are much less volatile&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blue</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blue/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Blue&lt;/em> is a retired Windows box, the first box in my “Let’s brush up on Windows!” series. It ranks as one of the easiest Windows boxes. I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a whole spree of boxes to try to brush up on my Windows technique. In the end, this box was more of an exercise in trying a whole bunch of exploits and dealing with really messed-up python environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>tldr;&lt;/strong>
If you&amp;rsquo;re doing this box in 2024 or later, go straight to a more recent version of the exploit. After you finish Recon, &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blue/#running-eternalblue">just skip right to this part of the walkthrough&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Analytics</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/analytics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/analytics/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this walkthrough, &lt;em>Analytics&lt;/em> is still active. The box centers around a fictional analytics company that provides data analysis services using the infrastructure they&amp;rsquo;re hosting. The company is running a popular open-source analytics / BI platform. This box uses a modern architecture, reflective of how real websites run these days (when they&amp;rsquo;re on-prem).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For each step of &lt;em>Analytics&lt;/em>, the skill emphasis is placed firmly on &lt;em>enumeration&lt;/em>. Combining effective enumeration skills with some good research is well-rewarded at every step of this box. For this box, foothold, user, and root are each only a single step. Once you research the right things, it should all fall right into your lap. Have some fun with this one; use this opportunity to sharpen your enumeration toolset.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bizness</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/bizness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/bizness/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Bizness&lt;/em>, at first glance, is a cheeky satire of the modern business landing page. It&amp;rsquo;s a website for a fictional company called BizNess that seemingly&amp;hellip; well, I can&amp;rsquo;t really tell what they do. They use a lot of fun buzz words though! &amp;#x1f60e; The entry into the server is all about attacking some well-known ERP software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Foothold on this box is a breeze. A little bit of enumeration and fingerprinting will lead to near-instantaneous success. Privilege escalation to root, however, is much more difficult. It will require you to enumerate very carefully, finding ways to tackle a system bloated with distracting configuration files, plugins, and log files everywhere. Not only that, but when you finally do find what you need, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to apply solid reasoning to take what you&amp;rsquo;ve found and transform it into escalation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Devvortex</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/devvortex/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/devvortex/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Currently, &lt;em>Devvortex&lt;/em> is still active and worth some points. The box revolves around a fictional web development company, and their landing page. A small amount of enumeration and a check for CVEs leads directly to an easy foothold. From there, good fundamentals will allow you to achieve the User flag with ease, then the root flag with even greater ease!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This box is perfect for anyone looking to get started in HTB, or someone (like me) who wants to renew their skills after a long hiatus. The biggest danger on this box is to accidentally over-think it &amp;#x1f609;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CozyHosting</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/cozyhosting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/cozyhosting/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Cozyhosting&lt;/em> was released as the penultimate box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s season II &amp;ldquo;Hackers Clash&amp;rdquo;. The box is set up as a server hosting a &lt;code>Spring Boot&lt;/code> application, with the challenge revolving around exploiting the web app to gain an initial foothold. The box uses common vulnerabilities and is definitely one of the easier boxes of the season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon for &lt;em>Cozyhosting&lt;/em> was important. A little bit of enumeration will yield a token with which you can hijack an existing session, giving you access to an admin dashboard. The admin dashboard has functionality inside it that can lead directly into a foothold - the only trick is in realizing what&amp;rsquo;s in front of you (Burp will be very useful here). Also, knowing a few tricks for escaping strings for shell command injection might help &amp;#x1f609;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zipping</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/zipping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/zipping/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Zipping&lt;/em> was released just minutes ago. It was released as the tenth box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. The box features a fictional e-commerce site (of what some might call a &amp;ldquo;lifestyle brand&amp;rdquo; *groan*). But good news - they&amp;rsquo;re hiring! With the ability to upload your CV, get ready for some file upload shenanigans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After initial entry, you&amp;rsquo;re presented with a very fun little reverse engineering / binex challenge. A firm grasp on linux and C fundamentals will be a huge asset for gaining the root flag. Privilege escalation was a real treat! Have fun &amp;#x1f44b;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybermonday</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/cybermonday/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/cybermonday/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this walkthrough, &lt;em>Cybermonday&lt;/em>was just released! It is the ninth box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. The site is a fictional e-commerce site. This box will test your knowledge of SQL, broken authentication, and definitely all the JWT tricks you can imagine! Have fun.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="recon">RECON&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="nmap-scans">nmap scans&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For this box, I&amp;rsquo;m running the same enumeration strategy as the previous boxes in the &lt;em>Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. I set up a directory for the box, with a &lt;code>nmap&lt;/code> subdirectory. Then set &lt;code>$RADDR&lt;/code> to my target machine&amp;rsquo;s IP, and scanned it with a simple but broad port scan:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keeper</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/keeper/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/keeper/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Currently, &lt;em>Keeper&lt;/em> is still active. It was released as the ninth box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. &lt;em>Keeper&lt;/em> is a very easy box, but with a few tricks up its sleeve. Personally, I found a few aspects of this box to be a little frustrating, but in retrospect those things that I found frustrating were probably the most realistic parts of the box. While it is marked as a Linux box, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a beginner&amp;rsquo;s grasp on some Windows tools to be able to escalate to root.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Download</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/download/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/download/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Currently, &lt;em>Download&lt;/em> is still active. It was released as the eighth box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em> (Half done the season now!). When &lt;em>Download&lt;/em> was released, it was originally marked as Medium - now it is Hard. I agree with this: discovering vulnerabilities on the box was quite obscure, more like a Hard difficulty box, but once you find those vulnerabilities, exploiting them is relatively easy. Gaining a foothold is the hardest part of &lt;em>Download&lt;/em>, happening in two steps: the first requires careful code analysis and possibly creating some tools of your own; the second requires a creative re-application of techniques usually used for a different type of application. For privilege escalation A bit of knowledge of &lt;em>the old ways&lt;/em> of privilege escalation will be invaluable for getting the root flag.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gofer</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/gofer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/gofer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this walkthrough, this is &lt;em>Gofer&lt;/em> is still active. It was released as the seventh box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. &lt;em>Gofer&lt;/em> is labeled as a &amp;ldquo;Hard&amp;rdquo; Linux box, but in reality it was probably closer to medium difficulty. This box centers around a fictional company that provides web development and web design services, although, given the security breach you&amp;rsquo;re about to dive into, perhaps they should transition to a different line of work. All in all, Gofer is very pleasant to run: the creator of the box clearly put great care into constructing a whole narrative and fictional context for the box. A little bit of enumeration, a few intelligent guesses, and a good knowledge of a few web tricks will gain you foothold&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RegistryTwo</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/registrytwo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/registrytwo/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this guide, &lt;em>RegistryTwo&lt;/em> is still active. It was released as the sixth box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. This box truly lives up to the level of &amp;ldquo;Insane&amp;rdquo;. Every step requires a very good grasp of hacking fundamentals. &lt;em>RegistryTwo&lt;/em> features a mixture of both open-source code and APIs, and homebrew Java applications. Careful code analysis skills and a very strong Java background is essential. This box will require you to either do a bit of coding or extensively modify some existing tools.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Authority</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/authority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/authority/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Authority&lt;/em> was released as the fifth box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. Is a &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo; Windows box, but will serve as a formidable challenge to any players unfamiliar with Windows. &lt;em>Authority&lt;/em> features a typical Microsoft environment, including Microsoft IIS server, LDAP, Kerberos, and SMB. No SSH here! You&amp;rsquo;ll have to rely on more rudimentary remote-connection methods. This box will test your filesystem enumeration skills, but not as much as your PKI knowledge. Get ready to think like a sysadmin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sau</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/sau/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/sau/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this walkthrough, this is still an Active box. It was released as the fourth box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. Sau is an &amp;ldquo;Easy&amp;rdquo; Linux box, named after its creator, &lt;strong>sau123&lt;/strong>. At face value, the box is a server hosting a web-app for collecting and displaying HTTP requests. The user is able to define &amp;ldquo;baskets&amp;rdquo; to catch requests, where the requests and their responses can later be analyzed - including their body and headers. Sau is a well-made easy box, with a straightforward path to the end. The foothold has multiple steps, emphasizing the importance of good enumeration and research. Once foothold is gained, recognition and understanding of the underlying vulnerability will ensure a quick sprint to the root flag.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intentions</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/intentions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/intentions/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Intentions was released on July 1, 2023 as the third box in &lt;em>Hackers Clash Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. It is a website that functions as an online image gallery. Users are also able to apply fancy &lt;em>effects&lt;/em> to images within the gallery. This box comes with cute animals, food pics, and a painfully difficult foothold. Achieving the user flag after foothold is relatively straightforward but reinforces some good hacking fundamentals. The root flag is quick, but requires wrapping your head around some cryptography concepts and formulating a customized solution to overcome the problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pilgrimage</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/pilgrimage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/pilgrimage/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this walkthrough, Pilgrimage is still an Active box. It was released as the second box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. The box features a webserver, hosting an application that shrinks images uploaded by the user, halving both the width and height of the image.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For this box, I&amp;rsquo;m running the same enumeration strategy as the previous box, &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/sandworm/walkthrough.html">Sandworm&lt;/a>. I set up a directory for the box, with a &lt;code>nmap&lt;/code> subdirectory. Then set &lt;code>$RADDR&lt;/code> to my target machine&amp;rsquo;s IP, and scanned it with a simple but broad port scan:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sandworm</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/sandworm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/sandworm/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this walkthrough, this is still an Active box. It was released as the very first box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. The box is hosting a webserver for a &amp;ldquo;Secret Spy Agency&amp;rdquo;. They seem to concern themselves with gathering intelligence from other agencies, but the website is mostly a tip-line: users can privately submit tips to SSA using their contact form and PGP key. The best part is, they even have a page that instructs you on proper usage of PGP &amp;#x1f609;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MonitorsTwo</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/monitorstwo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/monitorstwo/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Upon initial enumeration, the website hosted on MonitorsTwo is something called &amp;ldquo;Cacti&amp;rdquo;, which appears to be a run-of-the-mill website management panel. However, some searching reveals that it is an open-source tool, which gives more detail about its functionality:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cacti is a complete network graphing solution designed to harness the power of RRDtool&amp;rsquo;s data storage and graphing functionality providing the following features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remote and local data collectors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Device discovery&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automation of device and graph creation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Graph and device templating&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Custom data collection methods&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User, group and domain access controls&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Traverxec is an older box, dating back to 2019, created by a reasonably-famous HTB user named &lt;strong>jkr&lt;/strong>. It prominently features a very minimal webserver called &lt;strong>Nostromo&lt;/strong>. Nostromo is a quick win, reinforcing some key pentesting fundamentals: checking for CVEs and vulnerability recognition while on the local system (after gaining foothold). The procedure for this box is fairly straightforward - a little Linux knowledge will grant the root flag.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I wrote this walkthrough before I had figured out a methodical and consistent way to take notes. Please excuse the haphazard formatting and brevity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Busqueda</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/busqueda/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/busqueda/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For folks like myself that have &lt;em>nada espanol&lt;/em>, it turns out &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>busqueda&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; is Spanish for &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo;. It should be no surprise that this box is a search engine. Or rather, it is an aggregator of several search engines all in one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I followed my typical first steps. I set up a directory for the box, with a &lt;code>nmap&lt;/code> subdirectory. Then set $RADDR to my target machine&amp;rsquo;s IP, and scanned it with my typical nmap &amp;ldquo;init&amp;rdquo; scan:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Soccer</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/soccer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/soccer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At first, the target seems like a half-built Apache server. After a little enumeration, it seems like a single server hosting four website templates: one for music, one for interior design, one for artwork, and one that is generally-applicable.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s funny, but some of these seem like really nice templates.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>At first, the target seems like a half-built Apache server. After a little enumeration, it seems like a single server hosting four website templates: one for music, one for interior design, one for artwork, and one that is generally-applicable.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s funny, but some of these seem like really nice templates.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Bashed features an infosec developer&amp;rsquo;s blog. Seemingly, the blog has just one article. That article shows a pretty huge hint for how to complete the box. Bashed is a fairly easy box, but requires a bit of careful observation after obtaining a foothold. As usual, a basic understanding of linux is an asset.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I followed my typical first steps. I set up a directory for the box, with a &lt;code>nmap&lt;/code> subdirectory. Then set $RADDR to my target machine&amp;rsquo;s IP, and scanned it with my typical nmap &amp;ldquo;init&amp;rdquo; scan:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lame</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/lame/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2017 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/lame/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lame is one of the oldest boxes on HTB. Its solution is very direct: while it is a &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo;, it is actually shorter than many &amp;ldquo;challenges&amp;rdquo;. It is perfect for a beginner, or someone that just wants to brush up on some more introductory pentesting skills.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Precious is an Easy Linux box on HackTheBox, released on November 26, 2022. Its high rating and easy difficulty make it an attactive way to get back into HTB after a short hiatus. It prominently features the Ruby language, and usage of ruby gems - hence the name. While the foothold is fairly straightforward, the path to root takes a bit of thought!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Red Panda is a hilariously cute website that acts as an index for a bunch of photos of red pandas. The red panda photos each have an author marked on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a user visits the site, they may use the search bar to view the photos. When they do, it increments a view counter for that photo. Part of the site describes that the author who contributed the photo is then credited on a per-view basis. So not only does the site serve photos, it is also logging and processing the count of views for each photo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trick</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/trick/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/trick/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Trick appears to be a website that is under construction. At first glance, there is no functionality, but a little enumeration will reveal much more. Finding a foothold is not too difficult as long as proper enumeration techniques are followed. While this is an &amp;ldquo;Easy&amp;rdquo; box, the path to root takes a lot of creativity and forethought, and a bit of scripting. You&amp;rsquo;re fighting against a system that is trying to protect itself, but there is a way in!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>baby todo or not todo</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-todo-or-not-todo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-todo-or-not-todo/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This challenge is a docker container, coming packaged with a zip of all of the whole docker container (it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;white box&amp;rdquo; challenge.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open up the source code and read through it, get a sense of how the app is supposed to work. The name of the folder indicates &amp;ldquo;broken authentication control&amp;rdquo;, so that&amp;rsquo;s probably where this is headed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="first-take">FIRST TAKE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The db file &lt;strong>schema.sql&lt;/strong> is the first file to read. I find it&amp;rsquo;s easiest to get a handle on how an app works if you can see how the data is stored. The schema reveals what we should find once we do open the database. Once the website is running, the flag will be present in the table &lt;strong>todos&lt;/strong> (in the &lt;strong>name&lt;/strong> field) with assignee = admin&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>baby WAFfles order</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-waffles-order/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-waffles-order/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="first-take">FIRST TAKE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Download the challenge files: it is a docker, showing you the source code for the whole challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Obvious hint: the title of the website is &lt;strong>&lt;u>xxe&lt;/u>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-waffles-order/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read all the source code, understand how the web app works. In essence, the challenge is an order-taking API for a fictional restaurant, taking orders for either &lt;strong>Ice Scream&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>WAFfles&lt;/strong>. Orders may be submitted to /api/order as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>application/json&lt;/li>
&lt;li>application/xml&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="converting-request-to-xml">CONVERTING REQUEST TO XML&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It appears that the website is configured to submit orders as json, but the endpoint will still accept xml. Try running the docker and interacting with it: submit an order and catch the request in Burp. The POST will have content-type application/json, but go ahead and convert it to the equivalent XML request:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phonebook</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/phonebook/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/phonebook/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>

&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Found login page at http://api-prod.horizontall.htb/admin/auth/login

I could brute-force the login just with ffuf
Or I could try using the OpenSSH user enumeration CVE to obtain a list of users first?

The successful exploit was from https://github.com/dasithsv/CVE-2019-19609
I simply modified the port, (opened the firewall), set up a nc listener and got a shell
rhost was api-prod.horizontall.htb
lhost was 10.10.14.45
jwt was simply the jwt from my logged-in admin session (got it from firefox web dev tools)
url was http://api-prod.horizontall.htb/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This is the exploit I used:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
