Instead of just finishing it quickly, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d get around to doing something that has been on my To-Do list for far too long:
Finally learning to use Pwntools for CTFs &amp;#x1f480;
Usually, I just write socket code. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that this is clearly the &amp;ldquo;slow&amp;rdquo; way to do things. If I&amp;rsquo;m going to go faster in future CTFs, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to use some libraries to speed up my coding!</description></item><item><title>Baby Time Capsule</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-time-capsule/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-time-capsule/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION Baby Time Capsule is a cryptography challenge, rated &amp;ldquo;very easy&amp;rdquo;. Personally, I am not accustomed to crypto challenges, and found this one a lot more difficult than &amp;ldquo;very easy&amp;rdquo;. However, the solution only requires a very textbook attack. Anyone well-versed with RSA already should find it relatively simple.
Once identified, the solution is conceptually simple. Like other crypto challenges, there are several implementation pitfalls to avoid when scripting a solution.</description></item><item><title>The Last Dance</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/the-last-dance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2029 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/the-last-dance/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION The Last Dance is a cryptography challenge, rated &amp;ldquo;very easy&amp;rdquo;. It is an example of a very common cryptography lesson that illustrates why you should never re-use the same key when encrypting two messages. In this case, the &amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo; is actually a key/nonce pair, but that&amp;rsquo;s irrelevant to the solution. By recognizing three things, the player should find a solution pretty quickly:
&amp;ldquo;CHACHA20&amp;rdquo; is a stream cipher. It utilizes XOR (which is reversible) to encrypt and decrypt.</description></item></channel></rss>
