If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever programmed a REST API, perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve also used PUT and DELETE. Here&amp;rsquo;s the request your browser made when visiting my website:

I often forget small steps about testing SSRF. It&amp;rsquo;d be good to have a checklist to remind myself of things to investigate when I find an opportunity for SSRF.
This is by no means comprehensive. If you want a longer and more detailed guide, I recommend the Hacktricks page
ADDRESS FILTER BYPASS Even if an SSRF vulnerability is present, any half-decent web app will still filter the addresses that can be requested via the SSRFable component.</description></item><item><title>cURL Scripting</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/curl-scripting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/curl-scripting/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION Why write this? Because who needs browsers when you can just pipe curl into bash and parse with grep, sed, and awk &amp;#x1f639;
Sometimes I find myself in a circumstance where I want to do a little bit of automation/scripting with web requests, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like writing a whole Python script for it. At least for me, a really common circumstance for me wanting to do this is when I want to automate some kind of login where I encounter a CSRF check.</description></item><item><title>Filter Bypass Techniques</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/filter-bypass/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/filter-bypass/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION Why write this? Too often, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in a situation where I needed to bypass some kind of filter and wanted a checklist to reference. However, when searching for such a checklist, I encounter two difficulties with the references I find:
Information is far too task-specific. Many are only about XSS filter evasion, or only about WAFs. There&amp;rsquo;s just too much. Many of these references have hundreds of different techniques to try.</description></item><item><title>Login Forms</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/login-forms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/login-forms/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION The moment you encounter a login form can be magical: there are so many possibilities at your fingertips&amp;hellip; did they leave some default credentials on the system? Is there an SSRF? Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a way to bypass authentication completely?
Having so many options can be both a blessing and a curse. It can be a little daunting to have to keep so many techniques in mind, and to keep your eyes open for evidence of the form&amp;rsquo;s vulnerability to each.</description></item><item><title>Web Enumeration</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/web-enumeration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/web-enumeration/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION Why write this? Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve settled into a pretty good set of web enumeration techniques. As I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing more and more walkthroughs, it has started feeling quite repetetive always writing about the same web enumeration strategy. Why not skip that whole song-and-dance, and write it on a separate page that I can link to?
Most importantly, I like having a convenient reference for myself: it really speeds up recon on a box when you have exactly the right enumeration commands at your fingertips.</description></item></channel></rss>
