&lt;p>This challenge is a continuation of the previous one, &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/distract-and-destroy/">Distract and Destroy&lt;/a>. Our main character, Alex, now has two others in her party. Their objective is to somehow gain the key to the treasure (the flag) by eavesdropping on a rival party.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since a lot of the setup was done in the &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/">first challenge of the series&lt;/a>, I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering it again. Please see the &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/#setup">Setup&lt;/a> section of that walkthrough for more detail.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Distract and Destroy</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/distract-and-destroy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2029 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/distract-and-destroy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This challenge is a continuation of the previous one, &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/">Survival of the Fittest&lt;/a>. Our main character, Alex, is now accompanied by another person in her party (who I&amp;rsquo;m calling &amp;ldquo;Brock&amp;rdquo;, &lt;em>a la&lt;/em> alice-and-bob). The title, &lt;em>Distract and Destroy&lt;/em>, is a pretty huge hint in how this one will need to be solved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since a lot of the setup was done in the &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/">last challenge&lt;/a>, I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering it again. Please see the &lt;a href="https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/#setup">Setup&lt;/a> section of my other walkthrough for more detail.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Survival of the Fittest</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2029 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Starting up the challenge, it looks like a cute little web-based side scrolling RPG. The interface is limited to just &lt;code>Attack&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Restart&lt;/code>. Despite it&amp;rsquo;s simple appearance, this challenge is actually hosting a private blockchain, where the game is running as a distributed app. The goal is simple: kill the monsters.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This was my first blockchain challenge. Even though the challenge itself was very very easy, I was quite confused about how to set up the &lt;code>hardhat&lt;/code> environment. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this walkthrough in the hopes that others won&amp;rsquo;t have to stumble over the same issues that I did.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
