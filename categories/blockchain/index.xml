Our main character, Alex, now has two others in her party. Their objective is to somehow gain the key to the treasure (the flag) by eavesdropping on a rival party.
Since a lot of the setup was done in the first challenge of the series, I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering it again. Please see the Setup section of that walkthrough for more detail.</description></item><item><title>Distract and Destroy</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/distract-and-destroy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2029 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/distract-and-destroy/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION This challenge is a continuation of the previous one, Survival of the Fittest. Our main character, Alex, is now accompanied by another person in her party (who I&amp;rsquo;m calling &amp;ldquo;Brock&amp;rdquo;, a la alice-and-bob). The title, Distract and Destroy, is a pretty huge hint in how this one will need to be solved.
Since a lot of the setup was done in the last challenge, I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering it again.</description></item><item><title>Survival of the Fittest</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2029 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/survival-of-the-fittest/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION Starting up the challenge, it looks like a cute little web-based side scrolling RPG. The interface is limited to just Attack and Restart. Despite it&amp;rsquo;s simple appearance, this challenge is actually hosting a private blockchain, where the game is running as a distributed app. The goal is simple: kill the monsters.
This was my first blockchain challenge. Even though the challenge itself was very very easy, I was quite confused about how to set up the hardhat environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
