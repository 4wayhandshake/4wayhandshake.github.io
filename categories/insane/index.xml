&lt;p>&lt;em>WhiteRabbit&lt;/em> caps off HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 7, &lt;em>Vice&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s a fitting send-off to a very good season. &lt;em>WhiteRabbit&lt;/em> was very fun - it was long and difficult, but at no moment did it feel aimless or guessy. In terms of raw difficulty, it genuinely took some creativity but it is easier than other &amp;ldquo;Insane&amp;rdquo; difficulty boxes I&amp;rsquo;ve tried.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Recon&lt;/strong> is very important for &lt;em>WhiteRabbit&lt;/em>. It was refreshing that recon involved more than simple web app enumeration. Early in recon, you should discover a subdomain running a popular web app; I benefited greatly from taking the time to spin up a local copy of this web app. From the index page of the initial HTTP server, you&amp;rsquo;ll also see hints at another few web apps - taking the time to figure out &lt;em>how the target integrates all this tooling together&lt;/em> will help formulate a good plan of attack. The first web app you arrive at is essential for discovering the others (there are a few subdomains, and you will only be able to find &lt;em>one&lt;/em> of them through fuzzing).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RegistryTwo</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/registrytwo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/registrytwo/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this guide, &lt;em>RegistryTwo&lt;/em> is still active. It was released as the sixth box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. This box truly lives up to the level of &amp;ldquo;Insane&amp;rdquo;. Every step requires a very good grasp of hacking fundamentals. &lt;em>RegistryTwo&lt;/em> features a mixture of both open-source code and APIs, and homebrew Java applications. Careful code analysis skills and a very strong Java background is essential. This box will require you to either do a bit of coding or extensively modify some existing tools.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
