It is a website that functions as an online image gallery. Users are also able to apply fancy effects to images within the gallery. This box comes with cute animals, food pics, and a painfully difficult foothold.

FIRST TAKE The db file schema.sql is the first file to read.</description></item><item><title>baby WAFfles order</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-waffles-order/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/baby-waffles-order/</guid><description>FIRST TAKE Download the challenge files: it is a docker, showing you the source code for the whole challenge.
Obvious hint: the title of the website is xxe
Read all the source code, understand how the web app works. In essence, the challenge is an order-taking API for a fictional restaurant, taking orders for either Ice Scream or WAFfles. Orders may be submitted to /api/order as:
application/json application/xml CONVERTING REQUEST TO XML It appears that the website is configured to submit orders as json, but the endpoint will still accept xml.</description></item></channel></rss>
