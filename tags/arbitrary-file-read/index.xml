It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an odd box, in that the first half was very, very easy while the second half was more involved. This box forces you to explore many facets of Gitea, all the way from recon to root.
Recon is easy. We discover very quickly that there is a subdomain. Visiting that subdomain, we see it is a Gitea instance.</description></item></channel></rss>
