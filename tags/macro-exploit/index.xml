&lt;p>At the time of writing this walkthrough, this is &lt;em>Gofer&lt;/em> is still active. It was released as the seventh box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. &lt;em>Gofer&lt;/em> is labeled as a &amp;ldquo;Hard&amp;rdquo; Linux box, but in reality it was probably closer to medium difficulty. This box centers around a fictional company that provides web development and web design services, although, given the security breach you&amp;rsquo;re about to dive into, perhaps they should transition to a different line of work. All in all, Gofer is very pleasant to run: the creator of the box clearly put great care into constructing a whole narrative and fictional context for the box. A little bit of enumeration, a few intelligent guesses, and a good knowledge of a few web tricks will gain you foothold&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
