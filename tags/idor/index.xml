It makes for a nice ego boost after being pummeled by the last few boxes. The root blood on Nocturnal only took 21 minutes. While it took me substantially longer than that, I can confirm that this box is quite easy.

Solving this box requires a wide array of skills. However, while a many skills are required, none of the individual steps in the solution are painfully difficult. It is a long box though, with roughly equal amounts of labour required for foothold, the user flag, and for privilege escalation.</description></item></channel></rss>
