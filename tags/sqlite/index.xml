It had several good learning moments, but also a lot of really painful and time-consuming steps. It was very much a &amp;ldquo;CVE box&amp;rdquo;.

In the modern context of tech leaning heavily on open-source projects, Codify highlights an increasingly relevant issue: how do we deal with open-source dependencies when those packages go stale, unmaintained, or otherwise EOL? While this box was especially easy, it was an absolute delight to solve.</description></item></channel></rss>
