It is very short and easy. When I started the box, I wondered whether it was related to Cat from earlier in the season; it is not related, as far as I can tell. I would recommend this box to a beginner, especially someone who wants to test their recon and filesystem enumeration fundamentals.
On Dog, recon is everything.</description></item></channel></rss>
