&lt;p>Is it Linux? I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure&amp;hellip; &amp;#x1f914;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Lantern&lt;/em>, the third box in HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 6 &lt;em>Heist&lt;/em>, claims to be a Linux box, but in most respects actually it&amp;rsquo;s actually running things as one might in Windows. It isn&amp;rsquo;t until the very end of privesc to root that we find anything Linux-specific. &lt;em>Lantern&lt;/em> is about a generic IT services company running a landing page and an admin panel. What made this one a little special is its extensive use of &lt;em>Blazor&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intuition</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/intuition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/intuition/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I hope that Runner got you warmed up for HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 5, &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>&amp;hellip; because you&amp;rsquo;re going to need it - this one is tough! &lt;em>Intuition&lt;/em> was released as the second box of the season, requiring a wide array of skills to complete. &lt;em>Intuition&lt;/em> is very long: by my count, it has ten distinct steps to overcome (which classifies it as being on the harder end of &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; difficulty). Interestingly though, &lt;em>Intuition&lt;/em> requires very little in terms of &amp;ldquo;exploitation&amp;rdquo;; it&amp;rsquo;s mostly about finding and abusing simple misconfigurations/mistakes - which, I think, makes it a more realistic scenario than many HTB boxes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zipping</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/zipping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/zipping/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Zipping&lt;/em> was released just minutes ago. It was released as the tenth box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. The box features a fictional e-commerce site (of what some might call a &amp;ldquo;lifestyle brand&amp;rdquo; *groan*). But good news - they&amp;rsquo;re hiring! With the ability to upload your CV, get ready for some file upload shenanigans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After initial entry, you&amp;rsquo;re presented with a very fun little reverse engineering / binex challenge. A firm grasp on linux and C fundamentals will be a huge asset for gaining the root flag. Privilege escalation was a real treat! Have fun &amp;#x1f44b;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gofer</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/gofer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/gofer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the time of writing this walkthrough, this is &lt;em>Gofer&lt;/em> is still active. It was released as the seventh box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II&lt;/em>. &lt;em>Gofer&lt;/em> is labeled as a &amp;ldquo;Hard&amp;rdquo; Linux box, but in reality it was probably closer to medium difficulty. This box centers around a fictional company that provides web development and web design services, although, given the security breach you&amp;rsquo;re about to dive into, perhaps they should transition to a different line of work. All in all, Gofer is very pleasant to run: the creator of the box clearly put great care into constructing a whole narrative and fictional context for the box. A little bit of enumeration, a few intelligent guesses, and a good knowledge of a few web tricks will gain you foothold&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
