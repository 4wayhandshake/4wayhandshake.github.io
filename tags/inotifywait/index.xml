I came to Alert after a substantial hiatus, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did! It was pretty fun. Even though it is marked as Easy, I found the foothold challenging. Privesc to root was also very pleasant, albeit quick.
Recon is pretty simple on this one. Most of what we need can be obtained through a scan for subdomains and a crawl of the main website.</description></item></channel></rss>
