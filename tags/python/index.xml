Instead of just finishing it quickly, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d get around to doing something that has been on my To-Do list for far too long:
Finally learning to use Pwntools for CTFs &amp;#x1f480;
Usually, I just write socket code. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that this is clearly the &amp;ldquo;slow&amp;rdquo; way to do things. If I&amp;rsquo;m going to go faster in future CTFs, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to use some libraries to speed up my coding!</description></item><item><title>Spellbound Servants</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spellbound-servants/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spellbound-servants/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure about the description on this one&amp;hellip; To me, it just looks like a partially-finished storefront &amp;#x1f602;
As long as you don&amp;rsquo;t get too bogged-down with all the Flask-related code, this challenge is really easy. A bit of code analysis leads directly to the solution, which involves only a single step of deserialization to accomplish. Besides the vulnerability, this challenge presents a great example of writing a clean &amp;amp; tidy Flask server.</description></item><item><title>C O P</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/c-o-p/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/c-o-p/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION C O P (Cult of Pickles) is an Easy web challenge, involving requireing equal portions of SQLi, and deserialization, and brine. The challenge is a very minimal web app, demonstrating a bit of a &amp;ldquo;toy problem&amp;rdquo; with SQLi arising from a failure to use SQL prepared statements and sloppy Flask+Jinja2 templating code.
Achieving actual RCE is a bit challenging, but mostly because of a very strange issue. Formulation of your attack steps and writing the exploit is not too bad.</description></item><item><title>Python Environments</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/python-environment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 10:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/python-environment/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION Background: Why write this? The short answer is: I often forget how to do this, and I wanted a quick, no-B.S. reference for recreating a functional Python environment for hacking.
I know I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in believing that Python is the best tool for the job when you need something done quick and dirty. It&amp;rsquo;s great for writing proof-of-concept scripts, but also excels at console-based applications. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read enough of my walkthroughs, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that Python is my go-to language for automating all kinds of attacks, ranging from web to cryptography.</description></item></channel></rss>
