&lt;p>&lt;em>BigBang&lt;/em> was released as the third box of Season 7 &lt;em>Vice&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s rated as Hard, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s more correctly classified as Insane. It took me roughly 35h to complete, research and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon was pretty simple, at surface level. The target is just a standard Wordpress site. Do a bit of Wordpress-specific recon to find some interesting things about the site. Try finding the interactive elements on the page, and you will quickly see a way to upload files. If you can turn this into an arbitrary upload, you&amp;rsquo;re well on the way to foothold.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blurry</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blurry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blurry/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Blurry&lt;/em> was released as the eighth box in HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season V, &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>. This box is all about attacking an AI/ML platform called &lt;code>ClearML&lt;/code>. &lt;code>ClearML&lt;/code> is a system for orchestrating various AI/ML platforms, running models and experiments on a remote server. It has an extensive Python API, which we use repeatedly while solving this box. This box is on the easier side of &amp;ldquo;medium&amp;rdquo;, but was still a reasonable challenge.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
