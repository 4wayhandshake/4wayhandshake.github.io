A perfect choice if you have limited time but feel the itch to hack something. Kudos to the box creator, @dakkmaddy, for putting together this treat. It was released between Season 6 and 7.
Recon was pleasant, and a great reminder to always include some UDP scanning (even if it usually isn&amp;rsquo;t very useful). It was a mixture of OSINT, Web enumeration, and SNMP.</description></item></channel></rss>
