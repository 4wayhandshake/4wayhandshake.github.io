&lt;p>&lt;em>UnderPass&lt;/em> was a nice, quick and cheerful box. A perfect choice if you have limited time but feel the itch to hack something. Kudos to the box creator, &lt;em>@dakkmaddy&lt;/em>, for putting together this treat. It was released between Season 6 and 7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon was pleasant, and a great reminder to always include some UDP scanning (even if it usually isn&amp;rsquo;t very useful). It was a mixture of OSINT, Web enumeration, and SNMP. After gathering sufficient clues, it should be pretty easy to locate the correct service to attack. Hopefully, research already turned up some default credentials for the vulnerable service, because that&amp;rsquo;s what lets you into the dashboard.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
