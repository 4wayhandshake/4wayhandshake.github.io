&lt;p>&lt;em>LinkVortex&lt;/em> was all about the recon steps. A little bit of OSINT with a portion of web fuzzing is all that it takes. First though, we must discover the technology that the target website runs on, do a little reading on how it works, and make some educated guesses about directory structure: only then will we find the dashboard login. On the dashboard login, we discover a username oracle. Finally, after finding a vulnerable subdomain, we are able to do some &lt;code>.git&lt;/code> reconstruction to obtain some hardcoded credentials in the source code. Combining all of those clues together, we can finally gain access to the dashboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BoardLight</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/boardlight/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/boardlight/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>BoardLight&lt;/em> was the 6th box in HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season V &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy Linux box, focused on a web hosting platform. As far as I can tell, its name and icon have nothing to do with the box itself. Unfortunately, I was away when the box was released, and kicking myself for it - it would have been great to have such easy points on the scoreboard!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recon is very quick. &lt;code>Whatweb&lt;/code> reveals the domain of the target, and a quick scan for subdomains will reveal the vulnerable web app. From there, default credentials grant you entry to the web app dashboard. While the dashboard itself isn&amp;rsquo;t immediately useful, the credentials are helpful for the Authenticated RCE exploit that you can apply to the web app to gain a foothold.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
