&lt;p>&lt;em>Monitored&lt;/em> was released as the second box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season IV, &amp;ldquo;Savage Lands&amp;rdquo;. As is evident from visiting the index page of the box, this one centers around Nagios, an IT administration and monitoring solution for enterprise.

At least 90% of the effort for this box is spent on gaining a foothold - a moment which feels perpetually just out-of-reach. Nevertheless, this box is a hard teacher: reminding us to never give up and always &lt;em>hack harder&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
