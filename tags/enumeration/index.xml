I often forget small steps about testing SSRF. It&amp;rsquo;d be good to have a checklist to remind myself of things to investigate when I find an opportunity for SSRF.
This is by no means comprehensive. If you want a longer and more detailed guide, I recommend the Hacktricks page
ADDRESS FILTER BYPASS Even if an SSRF vulnerability is present, any half-decent web app will still filter the addresses that can be requested via the SSRFable component.</description></item><item><title>Web Enumeration</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/web-enumeration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/strategy/web-enumeration/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION Why write this? Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve settled into a pretty good set of web enumeration techniques. As I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing more and more walkthroughs, it has started feeling quite repetetive always writing about the same web enumeration strategy. Why not skip that whole song-and-dance, and write it on a separate page that I can link to?
Most importantly, I like having a convenient reference for myself: it really speeds up recon on a box when you have exactly the right enumeration commands at your fingertips.</description></item></channel></rss>
