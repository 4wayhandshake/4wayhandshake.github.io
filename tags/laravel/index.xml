The target is a server hosting a small blog and a set of administrative tools to manage the server. Also, the target features pretty cool little monitoring tool called Monit, and seemingly also clamAV (although it didn&amp;rsquo;t factor into the attack).
Foothold is the hardest part of Usage. After carefully examining the target and doing web enumeration on it, one only comes to the conclusion that the attack surface is quite small.</description></item><item><title>Horizontall (images only)</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/horizontall/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/horizontall/</guid><description>Introduction This walkthrough is just a series of screenshots showing how I got through the box. 🤷‍♂ I did this box before I really worked out a process for recording my work effectively. Sorry!
If I find the time, I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to this and try to document it properly.
Walkthrough These are the notes I left for myself:
Found login page at http://api-prod.horizontall.htb/admin/auth/login I could brute-force the login just with ffuf Or I could try using the OpenSSH user enumeration CVE to obtain a list of users first?</description></item></channel></rss>
