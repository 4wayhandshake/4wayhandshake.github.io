&lt;p>&lt;em>Resource&lt;/em> was released as first box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season 6, &lt;em>Heist&lt;/em>. The box was created by the famous user, &lt;code>0xdf&lt;/code> - and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint! This box establishes a whole fictional company and a narrative of the scenario, to a degree that is rare among HTB boxes. We find ourselves attacking an IT service company that is going through a period of their certificate and key management. The box is full of rabbit-holes and distractions, making it slightly frustrating but definitely a more realistic simulation than many other HTB boxes. Although the steps in &lt;em>Resource&lt;/em> tend to be short, they are numerous: by my count, I had to do five pivots between separate users to complete this box.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
