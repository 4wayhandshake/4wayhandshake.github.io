The box revolves around a fictional web development company, and their landing page. A small amount of enumeration and a check for CVEs leads directly to an easy foothold. From there, good fundamentals will allow you to achieve the User flag with ease, then the root flag with even greater ease!
This box is perfect for anyone looking to get started in HTB, or someone (like me) who wants to renew their skills after a long hiatus.</description></item></channel></rss>
