This one is all about breaking into a fictional company called that installs and operates physical security systems, such as security cameras and door access control. Surveillance is slightly long for a Medium box, involving many rabbit-holes and escalation between three users. However, if you keep your checklists handy and take good notes, this box won&amp;rsquo;t be too challenging.</description></item><item><title>Busqueda</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/busqueda/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/busqueda/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION For folks like myself that have nada espanol, it turns out &amp;ldquo;busqueda&amp;rdquo; is Spanish for &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo;. It should be no surprise that this box is a search engine. Or rather, it is an aggregator of several search engines all in one.
Warning: This walkthrough contains many spoilers. No spoilers will be unexpected if you read the walkthrough sequentially.
RECON I followed my typical first steps. I set up a directory for the box, with a nmap subdirectory.</description></item></channel></rss>
