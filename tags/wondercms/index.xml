With proper recon, it&amp;rsquo;s a very short box. Perhaps they will fix it after the season ends, but this box actually comes pre-exploited: to gain foothold, all you have to do is find the exploit and use it. It&amp;rsquo;s totally doable to figure out how to exploit it yourself though - that&amp;rsquo;s the method that I&amp;rsquo;ll outline in this walkthrough.</description></item></channel></rss>
