It makes for a nice little &amp;ldquo;coffee break&amp;rdquo; challenge. Perfect if you don&amp;rsquo;t have much time.
FIRST TAKE Start by downloading the files. It&amp;rsquo;s a docker container with a Flask application inside. Read the code, and realize there&amp;rsquo;s only one endpoint inside.
It&amp;rsquo;s a Python Flask server and uses Mako as a template engine.
FIND THE VULN Without too much code reading, it is clear that there probably isn&amp;rsquo;t a command injection here: there&amp;rsquo;s no obvious vulnerable code that normally leads to OS command injection.</description></item><item><title>Spookypass</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spookypass/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/ctf/spookypass/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION Super easy challenge. This challenge introduces a beginner at reversing into opening their tools and checking inside a file.
FIRST TAKE Start by downloading the file. We can check file to see the file type:
./pass: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=3008217772cc2426c643d69b80a96c715490dd91, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, not stripped
Try running the executable. It presents you with a simple prompt, asking the password:</description></item><item><title>Crafty</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/crafty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/crafty/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION Crafty is an easy-rated Windows box, released for week 6 of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season IV Savage Lands. This box centers around exploitation of log4j - maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of it &amp;#x1f602; It was a really big deal in 2021. While the disaster that ensued caused heaps of damage, very little actually changed as a result of its occurrence. If anything can be said for it, at least it stoked the international dialog on supply-chain attacks and the failing health of the open-source ecosystem.</description></item></channel></rss>
