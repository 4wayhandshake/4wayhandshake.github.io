At the face of it, Heal is about a website that has a simple resume-building service. I never really figured out how the name &amp;ldquo;Heal&amp;rdquo; relates to the box or icon. While it was on the easier side of &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to do way too much recon.
Everything you need to know from recon can be found by &amp;ldquo;spidering&amp;rdquo; the website using a web app proxy (I&amp;rsquo;ll be using ZAP in this one).</description></item><item><title>Pilgrimage</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/pilgrimage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/pilgrimage/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION At the time of writing this walkthrough, Pilgrimage is still an Active box. It was released as the second box for HTB&amp;rsquo;s Hackers Clash: Open Beta Season II. The box features a webserver, hosting an application that shrinks images uploaded by the user, halving both the width and height of the image.
RECON For this box, I&amp;rsquo;m running the same enumeration strategy as the previous box, Sandworm. I set up a directory for the box, with a nmap subdirectory.</description></item><item><title>Soccer</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/soccer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/soccer/</guid><description>INTRODUCTION At first, the target seems like a half-built Apache server. After a little enumeration, it seems like a single server hosting four website templates: one for music, one for interior design, one for artwork, and one that is generally-applicable.
It&amp;rsquo;s funny, but some of these seem like really nice templates.
The real action, as the name of the box suggests, is at the admin panel that manages the templates. It&amp;rsquo;s a site for typical web hosting tasks like managing hosts, editing DNS, adding users, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
