&lt;p>I arrived at &lt;em>Heal&lt;/em> a couple months after it was released. At the face of it, &lt;em>Heal&lt;/em> is about a website that has a simple resume-building service. I never really figured out how the name &amp;ldquo;Heal&amp;rdquo; relates to the box or icon. While it was on the easier side of &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to do way too much recon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything you need to know from recon can be found by &amp;ldquo;spidering&amp;rdquo; the website using a web app proxy (I&amp;rsquo;ll be using ZAP in this one). From here, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover a couple of subdomains and gain an understanding of how they work. The target in front of you is actually very minimal - almost everything is offloaded onto the subdomains. If you play with the app a little, you will surely notice a moment when the server trusts some data that it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t; exploiting that is half of the battle; the other half is doing research on common files that the target&amp;rsquo;s framework uses for configuration. This will lead to a successful foothold into a web app dashboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Perfection</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/perfection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/perfection/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Perfection&lt;/em> was released as the 9th box of HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season IV, &amp;ldquo;Savage Lands&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m coming to it two weeks late. I really enjoyed this box, even though it was quite easy. I always appreciate when the box creator builds a little bit of a narrative around the box: in this case, we were dealing with a small school and the interaction between two people (shown on the About Us page) regarding the school&amp;rsquo;s computer systems. There weren&amp;rsquo;t too many distractions on this one: if you know what you&amp;rsquo;re looking at, the solution for all steps should be readily apparent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Precious</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/precious/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/precious/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Precious is an Easy Linux box on HackTheBox, released on November 26, 2022. Its high rating and easy difficulty make it an attactive way to get back into HTB after a short hiatus. It prominently features the Ruby language, and usage of ruby gems - hence the name. While the foothold is fairly straightforward, the path to root takes a bit of thought!&lt;/p>
