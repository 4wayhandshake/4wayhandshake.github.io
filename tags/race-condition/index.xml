&lt;p>&lt;em>Alert&lt;/em> was released between seasons 6 and 7. I came to &lt;em>Alert&lt;/em> after a substantial hiatus, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did! It was pretty fun. Even though it is marked as Easy, I found the foothold challenging. Privesc to root was also very pleasant, albeit quick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Recon&lt;/strong> is pretty simple on this one. Most of what we need can be obtained through a scan for subdomains and a crawl of the main website. Early on, we discover a subdomain that is hiding behind &lt;code>http-basic-auth&lt;/code>, which is a hint that there may be either XSS required or credentials to obtain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blurry</title><link>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blurry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4wayhandshake.github.io/walkthrough/blurry/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Blurry&lt;/em> was released as the eighth box in HTB&amp;rsquo;s Season V, &lt;em>Anomalies&lt;/em>. This box is all about attacking an AI/ML platform called &lt;code>ClearML&lt;/code>. &lt;code>ClearML&lt;/code> is a system for orchestrating various AI/ML platforms, running models and experiments on a remote server. It has an extensive Python API, which we use repeatedly while solving this box. This box is on the easier side of &amp;ldquo;medium&amp;rdquo;, but was still a reasonable challenge.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
