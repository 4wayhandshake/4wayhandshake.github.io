It&amp;rsquo;s a well-designed box with little guesswork and good fundamentals; it makes for an excellent warmup for the rest of the season.
Recon reveals two HTTP servers. The first is a website running Camaleon CMS, the other is a cloud storage utility called MinIO. Spending a few extra minutes on vulnerability research is a great idea for Facts - it&amp;rsquo;ll help you move very quickly later on.</description></item></channel></rss>
