The target is a server hosting a small blog and a set of administrative tools to manage the server. Also, the target features pretty cool little monitoring tool called Monit, and seemingly also clamAV (although it didn&amp;rsquo;t factor into the attack).
Foothold is the hardest part of Usage. After carefully examining the target and doing web enumeration on it, one only comes to the conclusion that the attack surface is quite small.</description></item></channel></rss>
