# 4wayhandshake.github.io

My blog for infosec and CTF. This is where I post my HTB walkthroughs (and other things, too).

> THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## To Do:
- [x] Style homepage links and title.
- [x] Add Github link to header.
- [ ] Add Ko-fi link to header? :shrug:
- [ ] Style `list.html` for `/walkthrough`, `/ctf`, and `/strategy`.
- [ ] Use "page bundle" format for walkthroughs and CTF (rename each walkthrough to `index.md` and move it into the corresponding directory).
- [ ] Add word cloud for `/tags` and `/categories`.
- [ ] Start using Elasticlunr.js for search (add a token-collection script to be ran during website build process; add Elasticlunr.js to frontend).
